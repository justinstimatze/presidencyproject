Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-01-28,"In my first few days as your President, I've met with the leaders of some of our Nation's top manufacturing companies and labor unions. My message was clear: We want to make things in America, and we want to use American workers. Since my election, many companies have announced they are no longer moving jobs out of our country, but are instead keeping and creating jobs right here in America.  Every day, we are fulfilling the promise we made to the American people. Here are just a few of the executive actions that I have taken in the last few days: an order to prepare for repealing and replacing Obamacare—it's about time; the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership so that we can negotiate one-on-one deals that protect American workers—that would have been a disastrous deal for our workers; an order to begin construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines, following a renegotiation of terms, with the requirement that pipelines installed in America be built with American steel and manufactured here; a directive to expedite permits for new infrastructure and new manufacturing plants; an order to immediately begin the border wall and to crack down on sanctuary cities. They are not safe; we have to take care of that horrible situation.  This administration has hit the ground running at a record pace, everybody is talking about it. We are doing it with speed, and we are doing it with intelligence, and we will never, ever stop fighting on behalf of the American people.  God bless you, and God bless America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-02-03,"Ten years ago, the Senate unanimously approved Judge Gorsuch's nomination to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. I urge members of both parties to support Judge Gorsuch and, in so doing, to protect our laws and our freedoms.  This week, we also took significant action to roll back the massive regulation that is devastating our economy and crippling American companies and jobs. That's why I've issued a new Executive order to create a permanent structure of regulatory reduction. This order requires that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must—and I mean must—be eliminated. It's out of control.  The January employment report shows that the private sector added 237,000 jobs last month. A lot of that has to do with the spirit our country now has. Job growth far surpassed expectations in January, and the labor force participation also grew, so you can be encouraged about the progress of our economy. It's going to be a whole new ball game.  But there is still much work to do. That I can tell you.  Also this week, on the first day, Black History Month, I was pleased to host African American leaders at the White House. We're determined to deliver more opportunity, jobs, and safety for the African American citizens of our country. America can really never, ever rest until children of every color are fully included in the American Dream—so important. I think, probably, one of my most and maybe my most important goal. It is our mutual duty and obligation to make sure this happens.  At Dover Air Force Base, on Wednesday, I joined the family of Chief Special Warfare Operator William ""Ryan"" Owens as our fallen hero was returned home, a great man. Chief Owens gave his life for his country and for our people. Our debt to him and his family, a beautiful family, is eternal. God has truly blessed this Nation to have given us such a brave and selfless patriot as Ryan. We will never forget him. We will never ever forget those who serve, believe me.  And I will never forget that my responsibility is to keep you—the American people—safe and free. That's why, last week, I signed an Executive order to help keep terrorists out of our country. The Executive order establishes a process to develop new vetting and mechanisms to ensure those coming into America love and support our people; that they have good intentions.  On every single front, we are working to deliver for American workers and American families. You, the law-abiding citizens of this country, are my total priority. Your safety, your jobs, and your wages guide our decisions. We are here to serve you, the great and loyal citizens of the United States of America. The forgotten men and women will be never be forgotten again, because from now on, it's going to be America first. That's how I got elected, that's why you voted for me, and I will never forget it.  God bless you, and God bless America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-02-10,"My administration will make sure they have the support that they need and really desperately want. We're going to take care of them. It's remarkable to see Americans across the country come together to help families rebuild their lives. That is the beauty of the American spirit. There's nothing like it. There is a great spirit all over the country, and that spirit is what we will need to rebuild America to, as I have said so often, make America great again.  On Tuesday, I was pleased to host, at the White House, the CEO of Intel, who announced that Intel will invest $7 billion in a new manufacturing facility in Arizona, creating thousands of new American jobs. That's what we want: new American jobs and good jobs.  Intel decided to move forward with this project because they know we are totally committed to lifting the regulatory and tax burdens that are hurting American innovation and companies.  In fact, we are in the process right now of working on a major tax reform that will massively reduce taxes on our workers and businesses. We want to make it much easier to do business in America, and that's what we are going to do. We are going to make it also much harder for companies to leave. They're not just going to say bye-bye and fire everybody. There will be consequences.  I want America to be the great jobs magnet of the world, but we can't do that if we don't stop the wasteful rules and excessive taxes that make it impossible for companies to compete. Every hour of every day, my administration is focused on creating jobs for our people, and I mean good jobs, more jobs, better jobs, higher paying jobs. That's our mission.  This week, I also met with sheriffs and police chiefs from across the country. I pledged to them that we would stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement, and so too will our great new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions.  My administration is committed to your security, which is why we will continue to fight to take all necessary and legal action to keep terrorists—radical and dangerous extremists—from ever entering our country. We will not allow our generous system of immigration to be turned against us as a tool for terrorism and truly bad people. We must take firm steps today to ensure that we are safe tomorrow.  We will defend our country, protect our Constitution, and deliver real prosperity for our people.  God bless you, God bless America. Have a great week."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-02-17,"We have taken major steps during the first few weeks of my Administration to remove wasteful regulations and get our people back to work. I have been saying I was going to do that for a long time. This week I signed two pieces of legislation to remove burdens on our economy, continue to keep my promises to the American People and so much more. I signed House Joint Resolution 38, which eliminates an anti-coal regulation put forward by unelected bureaucrats. Our coal miners have been treated horribly, and we are going to turn that around - and we are going to turn it around quickly. We are going to fight for lower energy prices for all Americans as part of the deal. That's why I also signed a resolution to eliminate a costly regulation Dodd-Frank imposed on American energy companies. By stopping this regulation, we are able to save American companies and workers millions and millions of dollars in job-killing compliance costs. But to truly succeed as a country, we must realize the full potential of women in our economy. That is why I was thrilled to host the White House's women's business leaders roundtable—very exciting, great women. As President, I am committed to ensuring that women entrepreneurs have equal access to the capital, markets, and networks of support that they need, and I mean really need. And it's going to happen. This is a priority for my Administration. I campaigned on helping women in the workforce, and we are going to deliver on that promise, believe me. In fact, as part of my first official meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this week, we announced the creation of the joint United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. Actually, very exciting. The United States also reaffirmed our unbreakable bond this week with our cherished ally, Israel. It was an honor to welcome my friend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House. I affirmed to the Prime Minister America's commitment to working with Israel and our allies and partners toward greater security and stability. The threat of terrorism—and believe me it is a threat—must be confronted and defeated and we will defeat it. We share with Israel a deep conviction that we must protect all innocent human life. So as you head into the President's Day weekend, the American people should know that we are working tirelessly on your behalf. We are not here for the benefit of bureaucrats, consultants, or pundits—we are here to work for you, and only for you, the American people. Thank you, God Bless you and God Bless America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-02-25,"This week, I had the privilege of visiting the National Museum of African American History and Culture right here in Washington, D.C. It's a new, beautiful Smithsonian museum that serves as a shining example of African Americans' incredible contributions to our culture, our society, and our history. It also tells of the great struggle for freedom and equality that prevailed against the sins of slavery and the injustice of discrimination. The work and love of the people who helped create such a masterpiece is a testament to the legacy of so many leaders it honors. I left that museum confident that together, America can overcome any challenge. There's a great quote by Muhammad Ali in the museum – ""I shook up the world,"" he said. And that is what he did. So did leaders like Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Martin Luther King, and so many others. They shook up the world for the better because they inspired our Nation to march toward justice and freedom for all. Today, and every day, I pledge to continue that march so that every American – no matter his background, no matter her background – has the chance to climb that great ladder of success. It was very special to accompany Dr. Ben Carson and his family for the first time seeing the Carson exhibit. I am proud that soon he will serve in my cabinet as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. HUD has a very, very powerful meaning far beyond housing. It is about transforming our communities. About bringing back hope. And Ben will do a fantastic job. That's what I am committed to doing also. I want every African-American child, family, and worker to have access to great schools, safe communities, and good-paying jobs. I want every disadvantaged child in America to have a choice about where they go to school – so important. I also want to honor and promote the achievements of Historically Black Colleges and Universities throughout our Nation. They do a fantastic job. They are not given the credit that they deserve, and they are going to start getting that credit. In order to help African Americans thrive, we are working very hard to make sure every child can grow up in a safe community – and have access to high-paying jobs. We've lost a lot of our best jobs to other countries – and this has hurt the African American community very badly. This week I met with manufacturing CEOs – we're going to be working to bring back those jobs, and I mean really good-paying jobs. I will be talking more about these issues in my Joint Session Address to Congress and to all Americans next Tuesday evening. I hope you will be watching. Thank you, God bless you and God bless America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-03-03,"I'm joining you today from the deck of what will be our Nation's newest aircraft carrier, the soon-to-be commissioned Gerald R. Ford, and as you can see, I'm wearing a jacket and a hat that they just gave me. Not really used to it, but it feels awfully good — I'm very proud of it actually. Our carriers are the centerpiece of American military might, projecting power and our totally unparalleled strength at sea. This beautiful new warship represents the future of naval aviation, and she will serve as a cornerstone of our national defense for decades and decades to come. A famous aviator once wrote that, to build a truly great ship, we shouldn't begin by gathering wood, cutting boards, or distributing work, but instead by awakening within the people a ""desire for the vast and endless sea."" So true. In the same way, we must continue to renew the American spirit in order to rebuild our country, and rebuild it we will. On Tuesday, before a Joint Session [of] Congress, I laid out a vision — I hope you all watched — for how to accomplish that national rebuilding. My vision includes the elimination of the defense sequester, which has imposed steep cuts on our military. We must give our sailors, soldiers, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen the tools, equipment, resources and training they need to get the job done, and get it done right - especially in these very dangerous times. The active duty Army has been reduced by more than 85,000 men since 2009, and we have over 18,000 fewer active duty marines. The Air Force, it's the smallest it has been since 1947, and their planes are, on average, nearly thirty years old, if you can believe that. Our Navy's fleet is the smallest it has been since World War I, and that's a long time ago. Frontline Navy and Marine strike fighter aircraft are more likely to be down for maintenance than to be in the sky. We cannot afford to continue down this path. My budget will give America's armed forces the resources they need to achieve full and total military preparedness to meet any and all global challenges — and meet them, we will. Investing in the military means investing in peace - because the best way to prevent war, as George Washington said, is to be prepared for it. Most importantly, an investment in the military is an investment in the incredible men and women who serve our country in uniform. They are the best of us. They are the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known - and we will support them every single step of the way. These are truly exciting times. Amazing opportunities are unfolding before us - to strengthen our military, to reboot our economy, and to bring back our jobs. If we all work together, and put our country first, then anything is possible. Let us seize this moment and make the most of this incredible opportunity for national renewal. May God bless the men and women of our military, and may God bless the United States of America, the country we love."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-03-10,"In March, we celebrate Women's History Month, honoring the countless contributions that women leaders, scientists, and entrepreneurs have made throughout American history. We are a greater, stronger, and more just Nation today because of women like Clara Barton, Susan B. Anthony, Harriet Tubman, and so many others. We honor them and we recommit ourselves to a better future for every woman in America today. On my 50th day in office, I want to talk about an issue of paramount importance to families across our nation – healthcare. Seven years ago this month, Obamacare was signed into law over the profound objections of American people. Our citizens were told they would have to pass Obamacare to find out what it was and how bad it was. Now we know that the hundreds of pages were full of broken promises. Americans were promised that Obamacare would bring premiums down $2,500 for a typical family. Instead, they've gone up by more than $4,000. Americans were promised that Obamacare would increase competition and provide them with more choices. Instead, the number of plans to choose from has plummeted – and I mean plummeted. This year, Americans in nearly one-third of all counties have only one insurer to choose from on the exchanges – or, in effect, no real choice at all. Americans were promised that if they liked their health insurance and their doctors, they could keep them. Instead, millions of Americans lost the insurance and lost the doctor that they liked and were thrust into a cold new reality of higher costs and less coverage. Through seven long years of botched rollouts, soaring costs, cancelled plans, and bureaucratic mandates, Americans have called out for relief. And relief is what we are determined to give them. I want every American to know that action on Obamacare is an urgent necessity. The law is collapsing around us, and if we do not act to save Americans from this wreckage, it will take our healthcare system all the way down with it. If we do nothing, millions more innocent Americans will be hurt – and badly hurt. That's why we must repeal and replace Obamacare. House Republicans have put forward a plan that gets rid of this terrible law and replaces it with reforms that empower states and consumers. You will have the choice and the freedom to make the decisions that are right for your family. The House plan follows the guidelines I laid out in my recent address to Congress – expanding choice, lowering costs, and providing healthcare access for all. This plan is part of a three-pronged reform process. In concert with the plan in front of Congress, I have directed Dr. Tom Price, our Secretary of Health and Human Services, to use his authority to reduce regulations that are driving up costs of care. We are also working on reforms that lower the costs of care, like allowing Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines. You've heard me say that many, many times during the debates. I encourage Democrats to work with us to improve the healthcare system for the American people. Also, we will be driving down the costs. We will deliver relief to American workers, families, and small businesses, who right now are being crushed by Obamacare, by increasing freedom, choice, and opportunity for the American people. Thank you very much."
