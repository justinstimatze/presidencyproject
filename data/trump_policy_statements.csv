Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 7 - No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017,2017-01-24,"(House)(Rep. Smith, R-New Jersey, and 47 cosponsors)  The Administration strongly supports H.R. 7. The legislation would prohibit any funds authorized or appropriated by Federal law to be expended for any abortion, or for direct payments to insurers for health benefits coverage that includes coverage for abortions. H.R. 7 also would prohibit the purchase of abortion coverage with matching funds from federally subsidized programs, including Federal and State Medicaid funds. The legislation would not relate to the treatment of any complication caused by or worsened by an abortion, nor to the treatment of abortions in the case of rape, incest, or preserving the life of the mother. This bill would continue to prohibit the Federal government from paying for affected procedures with the taxes of Americans who find abortion morally or religiously objectionable. If the President were presented with H.R. 7 in its present form, he would sign the bill."
"Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.J. Res. 38, H.J. Res. 36, H.J. Res. 41, H.J. Res. 40, & H.J. Res. 37",2017-02-01,"(House) H.J. Res. 38 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of the Interior Known as the Stream Protection Rule(Rep. Johnson, R-OH, and 67 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 36 – Disapproving the Bureau of Land Management's Final Rule Relating to ""Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation""(Rep. Bishop, R-UT, and 33 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 41 – Disapproving the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule on Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers(Rep. Huizenga, R-MI, and 32 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 40 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Social Security Administration Relating to Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007(Rep. Johnson, R-TX, and 120 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 37 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Relating to the Federal Acquisition Regulation(Rep. Foxx, R-NC, and 3 cosponsors) The Administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations imposed on America's businesses. The regulations that the House is voting to overturn under the Congressional Review Act have established burdensome compliance requirements that force jobs out of our communities and discourage doing business in the United States. The House is also considering overturning a Social Security Administration Rule that would prevent some Americans with disabilities from purchasing or possessing firearms based on their decision to seek Social Security benefits. H.J. Res. 38 would nullify the Stream Protection Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. 93066 (Dec. 20, 2016), a final rule recently promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. The bill disapproves a rule that would establish onerous requirements for coal mining operations, and impose significant compliance burdens on America's coal production. The disapproved rule also duplicates existing protections in the Clean Water Act and is unnecessary given the other Federal and State regulations already in place. The Administration is committed to reviving America's coal mining communities, which have been hurting for too long. H.J. Res. 36 would nullify the final rule Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation. 81 Fed. Reg. 83008 (Nov. 18, 2016), promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management. The bill disapproves an expensive rule that would require oil and gas producers to reduce natural gas waste and emissions, regardless of whether or not it is economically viable to do so. The majority of affected oil and gas operators are small businesses, and productive wells could be unnecessarily shut in to meet the requirements of this rule. While minimizing waste remains an important component of responsible energy development, the Administration is committed to reducing regulatory burdens on American businesses, supporting energy policies that lower costs for hardworking Americans, maximizing the use of American resources, and freeing us from dependence on foreign oil. H.J. Res. 41 would nullify the final rule Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers, 81 Fed. Reg. 49359 (July 27, 2016), promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The bill disapproves a rule that would require resource extraction issuers to report payments made to governments for the commercial development of oil, natural gas or minerals. In some cases, the rule would require companies to disclose information that the host nation of their project prohibits from disclosure or is commercially sensitive. The rule would impose unreasonable compliance costs on American energy companies that are not justified by quantifiable benefits. Moreover, American businesses could face a competitive disadvantage in cases where their foreign competitors are not subject to similar rules. H.J. Res. 40 would nullify the final rule Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, 81 Fed. Reg. 91702 (Dec. 19, 2016), promulgated by the Social Security Administration (SSA). The bill disapproves a rule that would allow SSA to provide records on certain individuals who receive Disability Insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act or Supplemental Security Income payments under title XVI of the Social Security Act to the Attorney General for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The rule would prevent some Americans with disabilities from purchasing or possessing firearms based on their decision to seek Social Security benefits. Applications of this rule could endanger the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens. H.J. Res. 37 would nullify the rule Federal Acquisition Regulation; Fair Pay and Safe Workspaces, 81 Fed. Reg. 58562 (August 25, 2016). The bill disapproves a rule that would require federal contractors to disclose findings of non-compliance with labor laws. The rule would bog down Federal procurement with unnecessary and burdensome processes that would result in delays, and decreased competition for Federal government contracts. Rolling back this rule will also help to reduce costs in Federal procurement. The Administration is committed to reducing onerous regulatory burdens on America's businesses and using existing authorities to continue enforcing the Nation's workplace laws. If these bills were presented to the President in their current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign them into law."
"Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.J. Res. 42, H.J. Res. 44, H.J. Res. 57, H.J. & H.J. Res. 58",2017-02-07,"(House) H.J. Res. 42 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Labor Relating to Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants(Rep. Brady, R-TX, and 25 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 44 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of the Interior Relating to Bureau of Land Management Regulations that Establish the Procedures Used to Prepare, Revise, or Amend Land Use Plans Pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976(Rep. Cheney, R-WY, and 16 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 57 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Education Relating to Accountability and State Plans Under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965(Rep. Rokita, R-IN, and 12 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 58 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Education Relating to Teacher Preparation Issues(Rep. Guthrie, R-KY, and 12 cosponsors) The Administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations. The regulations that the House is voting to overturn under the Congressional Review Act establish onerous reporting requirements and other constraints on States, local communities, and institutions of higher education. H.J. Res. 42 would nullify the Employment and Training Administration's Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program; Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 Provision on Establishing Appropriate Occupations for Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants 81 Fed. Reg. 50298 (August 1, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Labor. The rule determines the occupations that regularly conduct drug testing for use by States when determining which unemployment insurance applicants may be tested. The rule imposes an arbitrarily narrow definition of occupations and constrains a State's ability to conduct a drug testing program in its unemployment insurance system, as authorized in Public Law 112-96, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. H.J. Res. 44 would nullify the final rule relating to Resource Management Planning, 81 Fed. Reg. 89580 (Dec. 12, 2016), promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM). This rule, also known as the BLM Planning Rule 2.0, would prioritize regional and national considerations over state and local interests in land use planning for activities on public lands. The BLM manages over 245 million acres of Federal lands, located mostly in the western States, for multiple uses, including grazing, timber, recreation, and energy and mineral development. Given its regional approach to planning, the Administration believes the rule does not adequately serve the State and local communities' interests and could potentially dilute their input in planning decisions. H.J. Res. 57 would nullify the final rule Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act – Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed. Reg. 86076 (Nov. 29, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education. This rule establishes requirements for how States must implement the statutory provisions that require States to have an accountability system based on multiple measures, including school quality or student success, to ensure that States and districts focus on improving outcomes and measuring student progress. While school accountability is important, the Administration is committed to local control of education and this rule places additional burden on States and constrains them in areas where the ESSA intended broad flexibility. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on how the Department of Education can support States and school districts as they implement the new reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. H.J. Res. 58 would nullify the final rule related to the Teacher Preparation Program Accountability System, 81 Fed. Reg. 75494 (Oct. 31, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education. This rule establishes annual State reporting to measure the performance and quality of teacher preparation programs and tie them to program eligibility for participation in the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education grant program. The rule imposes new burdensome and costly data reporting requirements on States and institutions of higher education. If these bills were presented to the President in their current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign them into law."
"Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.J. Res. 83 - Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Labor Relating to ""Clarification of Employer's Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury and Illness""",2017-02-28,"(House)(Rep. Byrne, R-AL) The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.J. Res. 83. The resolution would nullify the final rule titled ""Clarification of Employer's Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury and Illness,"" 81 Fed. Reg. 91792 (Dec. 19, 2016) promulgated by the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The rule purports to clarify OSHA's recordkeeping requirements by allowing OSHA to cite employers for up to five years for failing to make and maintain injury and illness records. The Administration is committed to reducing regulatory burdens on America's businesses, and this rule imposes costs on employers resulting from continuing recordkeeping obligations. If this bill were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign it into law."
"Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 998, H.R. 1004 & H.R. 1009",2017-02-28,"(House) H.R. 998 – Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome (SCRUB) Act(Rep. Smith, R-MO, and three cosponsors) H.R. 1004 – Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017(Rep. Walberg, R-MI, and eight cosponsors) H.R. 1009 – OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act(Rep. Mitchell, R-MI, and four cosponsors) The Administration is committed to reducing regulatory burden on all Americans. On January 30, 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order 13771, Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, which provides for repeal of two regulations for every new one issued. This historic step accelerates the retrospective review process to make common-sense reforms to regulations across the Federal Government. Legislation is helpful where it amends agencies' regulatory processes to ensure they are transparent, and appropriately balance costs and benefits. Each of these bills would address different aspects of the regulatory process. The SCRUB Act, H.R. 998, addresses the numerous outdated, duplicative, and otherwise unnecessary regulations that have accumulated throughout government. The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017, H.R. 1004, would restrict the use of agency funds to advocate on behalf of regulations, and the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act, H.R. 1009, would codify specific executive branch regulatory review procedures. The Administration supports the SCRUB Act, the Regulatory Integrity Act, and the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on technical and other amendments to these bills. The Administration appreciates the efforts of the Congress to rationalize the regulatory system and looks forward to continuing to work together to reform the regulatory process."
"Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 1301 - Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2017",2017-03-07,"(House Rules)(Rep. Frelinghuysen, R-NJ) The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1301, making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes. The bill funds critical national security needs. The Administration is committed to working with the Congress on a sustained effort to rebuild the military. In the coming weeks, the Administration plans to request additional FY 2017 appropriations to improve the warfighting readiness of the military and provide the resources needed to accelerate the defeat of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward."
Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.J. Res. 67 and 66 - Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Labor,2017-03-13,"(Senate) H.J. Res. 66 - Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Labor Relating to Savings Arrangements Established by States for Non Governmental Employees(Rep. Walberg, R-MI, and seven cosponsors) H.J. Res. 67 - Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Labor Relating to Savings Arrangements Established by Qualified State Political Subdivisions for Non Governmental Employees(Rep. Rooney, R-FL, and seven cosponsors) The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.J. Res. 66 and H.J. Res. 67. These joint resolutions of disapproval would nullify two rules promulgated by the Employee Benefits Security Administration of the Department of Labor: (1) Savings Arrangements Established by States for Non-Governmental Employees, 81 Fed. Reg. 59464 (Aug. 30, 2016); and (2) Savings Arrangements Established by Qualified State Political Subdivisions for Non-Governmental Employees, 81 Fed. Reg. 92639 (Dec. 20, 2016), respectively. The rules allow a new type of State-based retirement plan that would lack important Federal protections, and they would give a competitive advantage to these public plans. These joint resolutions would prevent the Department of Labor from reissuing a rule that is substantially the same as the disapproved rule absent specific future congressional authorization. If these bills were presented to the President in their current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign them into law."
