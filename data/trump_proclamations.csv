"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9571—National School Choice Week, 2017",2017-01-26,"The foundation of a good life begins with a great education. Today, too many of our children are stuck in schools that do not provide this opportunity.  Because the education of our young people is so important, the parents of every student in America should have a right to a meaningful choice about where their child goes to school.  By expanding school choice and providing more educational opportunities for every American family, we can help make sure that every child has an equal shot at achieving the American Dream. More choices for our students will make our schools better for everybody.  Our country is home to many great schools and many extraordinary teachers—whether they serve in traditional public schools, public charter schools, magnet schools, private or religious schools, or in homeschooling environments.  With a renewed commitment to expanding school choice for our children, we can truly make a great education possible for every child in America.  I commend our Nation's students, parents, teachers, and school leaders for their commitment to quality, effective education, and I call on States and communities to support effective education and school choice for every child in America.  As our country celebrates National School Choice Week, I encourage parents to evaluate the educational opportunities available for their children. I also encourage State lawmakers and Federal lawmakers to expand school choice for millions of additional students.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 22 through January 28, 2017, as National School Choice Week.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9572—National African American History Month, 2017",2017-02-01,"As we celebrate National African American History Month, we recognize the heritage and achievements of African Americans. The contributions African Americans have made and continue to make are an integral part of our society, and the history of African Americans exemplifies the resilience and innovative spirit that continue to make our Nation great.  For generations, African Americans have embodied the shared progress of our Nation. Through toil and struggle and with courageous actions that have broken barriers, they have made America a better place to live and work for everybody. Women like Katherine Johnson, a pioneer in space history whose work helped America win the Space Race, and Madam C.J. Walker, who became one of the most successful female entrepreneurs of her time, paved the way for both women and African Americans in their respective fields. Robert Smalls, a man born into slavery, founded our Nation's first free and compulsory public school system. Later in life, he served as a lawmaker in South Carolina's State legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives. The strength and determination of men and women like these remind us that our Nation brims with people whose contributions continue to make it stronger and better.  This year, African American History Month calls upon us to reflect on the crucial role of education in the history of African Americans. It reminds us of the importance of teaching and reflecting upon the many roles African Americans have played in building this Nation and driving it forward. This year's theme also calls upon us to rededicate ourselves to the work of ensuring that all children in this Nation have access to quality educational opportunities that give them the skills, experiences, relationships, and credentials that can empower them to follow in the footsteps of people like Katherine Johnson, Madam C.J. Walker, and Robert Smalls.  As we journey toward a stronger, more united Nation, let us use this commemoration of African American History Month to serve as a reminder of the need for meaningful dialogue and shared commitment to collective action that uplifts and empowers, as well as of the strength, ingenuity, and perseverance required of us in the years to come.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2017 as National African American History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9573—American Heart Month, 2017",2017-02-02,"The death rate from heart disease in the United States has fallen dramatically since the 1960s, a significant public health victory. Despite this progress, heart disease remains a leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States, and we must reduce its toll. During American Heart Month, we remember those who have lost their lives to heart disease and resolve to improve its prevention, detection, and treatment. It is a time for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to improving cardiovascular health—for ourselves, our families, and our communities.  Over the past several decades, we have learned much about factors that contribute to heart disease, how to monitor those triggers, and ways to treat them. We know that individuals can live longer and better lives by refraining from tobacco use, maintaining an optimal blood pressure and a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Innovative companies continue to offer new tools and online systems, giving people more access than ever to information they can use to make informed, health-conscious choices.  Scientific research and evidence-based interventions to prevent or treat heart attacks and strokes have played an important part in making these strides. Developments in technology and the discovery of early markers of heart disease have allowed us to diagnose and treat heart disease sooner than ever before. American innovators continue to develop treatments for high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and our health care providers continue to promote best strategies and educate Americans to stay heart healthy.  To highlight the importance of preventing heart disease, Melania and I invite all Americans to wear red this Friday, February 3, 2017, to observe National Wear Red Day. Working together on National Wear Red Day, and throughout the year, we can raise awareness about heart disease and make our Nation healthier.  In acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved on December 30, 1963, as amended (36 U.S.C. 101), has requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating February as American Heart Month.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 2017 as American Heart Month, and I invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 3, 2017. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9576—Women's History Month, 2017",2017-03-01,"We are proud of our Nation's achievements in promoting women's full participation in all aspects of American life and are resolute in our commitment to supporting women's continued advancement in America and around the world. America honors the celebrated women pioneers and leaders in our history, as well as those unsung women heroes of our daily lives. We honor those outstanding women, whose contributions to our Nation's life, culture, history, economy, and families have shaped us and helped us fulfill America's promise. We cherish the incredible accomplishments of early American women, who helped found our Nation and explore the great western frontier. Women have been steadfast throughout our battles to end slavery, as well as our battles abroad. And American women fought for the civil rights of women and others in the suffrage and civil rights movements. Millions of bold, fearless women have succeeded as entrepreneurs and in the workplace, all the while remaining the backbone of our families, our communities, and our country. During Women's History Month, we pause to pay tribute to the remarkable women who prevailed over enormous barriers, paving the way for women of today to not only participate in but to lead and shape every facet of American life. Since our beginning, we have been blessed with courageous women like Henrietta Johnson, the first woman known to work as an artist in the colonies; Margaret Corbin, who bravely fought in the American Revolution; and Abigail Adams, First Lady of the United States and trusted advisor to President John Adams. We also remember incredible women like Mary Walker, the first woman to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor; Harriet Tubman, who escaped slavery in 1849 and went on to free hundreds of others through the Underground Railroad; Susan B. Anthony, the publisher and editor of The Revolution and her friend, Dr. Charlotte Lozier, one of the first women medical doctors in the United States, both of whom advocated for the dignity and equality of women, pregnant mothers, and their children; Rosa Parks, whose refusal to give up her seat accelerated the modern civil rights movement; Shirley Temple Black, the famous actress turned diplomat and first chief of protocol for the President of the United States; Anna Bissell, the first woman CEO in American history; Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean; Ella Fitzgerald, the First Lady of Song and the Queen of Jazz; and Sally Ride, the first American woman astronaut. America will continue to fight for women's rights and equality across the country and around the world. Though poverty holds back many women, America cannot and will not allow this to persist. We will empower all women to pursue their American dreams, to live, work and thrive in safe communities that allow them to protect and provide for themselves and their families. America is also mindful of the fight that continues for so many women around the world, where women are often not protected and treated disgracefully as second-class citizens. America will fight for these women too, and it will fight to protect young girls who are robbed of their rights, trafficked around the world, and exploited. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2017 as Women's History Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9574—American Red Cross Month, 2017",2017-03-01,"For more than 135 years, the American Red Cross has stepped into the breach, providing shelter, food, and emotional support to victims of natural disaster, war, conflict, and unexpected hardship. Today, the Red Cross is responsible for a remarkable 40 percent of our Nation's blood supply, teaches life-saving techniques to volunteer citizen-rescuers, and leads the world in international humanitarian aid. The Red Cross has proudly and ardently supported our military, our veterans, and their families for more than a century, delivering over 352,000 services to members of the military and veterans each year. The American Red Cross is a miracle-working organization, rooted in the legacy of its gallant founder, Clara Barton, who tore down every convention at the time regarding women in battle, giving history one of the most incredible examples of courage and devotion to duty that it has ever known. Her tremendous legacy lives on through the Red Cross's assistance to hundreds of thousands of Americans affected by disasters each year. In 2016, volunteers responded to 180 significant incidents, including wildfires, storms, flooding, Hurricane Matthew, and other emergencies at all times of the day and night. They opened nearly 800 emergency shelters, served more than 4.1 million meals and snacks, and distributed more than 2.1 million relief items. Last year, the Red Cross helped 79,000 families recover from home fires that left them with no place to go. The comfort, care, and relief provided by the American Red Cross serves a great mission. When those in need see that recognizable symbol of hope, the Red Cross, they see the hearts of the American people at work ?? an incredibly powerful thing. When they see that beacon, they know that true help is on the way, and they feel our people's mighty generosity, love, and support for their fellow human beings. To perform its vital national and international roles, the Red Cross relies on volunteers and the support of the American people. The Red Cross needs our continued commitment of time, resources, and funds to be successful, and our country and the world need the Red Cross. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2017 as American Red Cross Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities, and by supporting the work of service and relief organizations. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9575—Irish-American Heritage Month, 2017",2017-03-01,"Irish Americans have made an indelible mark on the United States. From Dublin, California, to Limerick, Maine, from Emerald Isle, North Carolina, to Shamrock, Texas, we are reminded of the more than 35 million Americans of Irish descent who contribute every day to all facets of life in the United States. Over generations, millions of Irish have crossed the ocean in search of the American Dream, and their contributions continue to enrich our country today. From our four Irish-born Founding Fathers to Thomas Francis Meagher, the Irish revolutionary who became an American hero after leading the Irish Brigade during the Civil War, Irish immigrants have shaped our history in enduring ways. Throughout the centuries, hard-working Irish Americans have contributed to America's innovation and prosperity -- tilling the farms of Appalachia, working the looms of New England textile mills, and building transcontinental railroads -- often overcoming poverty and discrimination and inspiring Americans from all walks of life with their indomitable and entrepreneurial spirit in the process. From these early beginnings rose generations of Irish Americans who continue to lead our cities, drive our economy, and protect and defend the land they embrace as their own. American culture carries an unmistakably Irish-American imprint. Our literature, cinema, music, dance, sports, and visual arts are filled with the names and influence of great Irish Americans. Irish Americans should be proud of the deep cultural, historical, and familial ties that have contributed to the strength of our vibrant transatlantic relationship with Ireland. As we honor the past during Irish-American Heritage Month, we also celebrate a bright future of friendship and cooperation for generations to come. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2017 as Irish-American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the achievements and contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9577—National Consumer Protection Week, 2017",2017-03-06,"The economic strength and vitality of our Nation is directly linked to our consumers' confidence in the integrity and security of their personal information and the robust protection of their privacy. As an increasing number of transactions and activities occur online, the safety of vital consumer information is increasingly at risk. The American people deserve freedom from unscrupulous actors who perpetrate identity theft, abuse personal information, or engage in fraud. Cyber crimes, which defraud hard-working Americans, cost our families billions of dollars each year and result in tremendous stress, loss of time, and hardship. Americans must have access to the tools necessary to protect their personal information and privacy and know how to use them to improve their online security. Our first defense against fraudulent cyber transactions and the misuse of personal information will always be a well-informed consumer.  National Consumer Protection Week reminds us of the importance of empowering consumers by helping them to more capably identify and report cyber scams, monitor their online privacy and security, and make well-informed decisions. The Federal Government, in conjunction with a network of national organizations and State and local partners, provides consumer education resources to help Americans protect their personal information. These resources assist military service members and their families, identity-theft victims, and all potentially vulnerable consumers. Our work to protect consumers from identity theft, abuse of personal information, and fraud, and to improve the integrity and security of our marketplaces, enhances the prosperity of our great country. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 5 through March 11, 2017, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call upon government officials, industry leaders, and advocates to educate our citizens about the protection of personal information and identity theft through consumer education activities in communities across the country. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first. DONALD J. TRUMP"
