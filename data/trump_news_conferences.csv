Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom,2017-01-27,"The special relationship between our two countries has been one of the great forces in history for justice and for peace. And by the way, my mother was born in Scotland—Stornoway—which is serious Scotland. [Laughter]  Today the United States renews our deep bond with Britain: military, financial, cultural, and political. We have one of the great bonds. We pledge our lasting support to this most special relationship. Together, America and the United Kingdom are a beacon for prosperity and the rule of law. That is why the United States respects the sovereignty of the British people and their right of self-determination. A free and independent Britain is a blessing to the world, and our relationship has never been stronger.  Both America and Britain understand that governments must be responsive to everyday working people, that governments must represent their own citizens.  Madam Prime Minister, we look forward to working closely with you as we strengthen our mutual ties in commerce, business, and foreign affairs. Great days lie ahead for our two peoples and our two countries.  On behalf of our Nation, I thank you for joining us here today. It's a really great honor. Thank you very much.  Prime Minister May. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. And can I start by saying that I'm so pleased that I've been able to be here today. And thank you for inviting me so soon after your Inauguration. And may—and I'm delighted to be able to congratulate you on what was a stunning election victory.  President Trump. Thank you.  Prime Minister May. And, as you say, the invitation is an indication of the strength and importance of the special relationship that exists between our two countries, a relationship based on the bonds of history, of family, kinship, and common interests. And in a further sign of the importance of that relationship, I have today been able to convey Her Majesty the Queen's hope that President Trump and the First Lady would pay a state visit to the United Kingdom later this year. And I'm delighted that the President has accepted that invitation.  Now, today we're discussing a number of topics, and there's much on which we agree. The President has mentioned foreign policy. We are discussing how we can work even more closely together in order to take on and defeat Daesh and the ideology of Islamist extremism wherever it's found.  Our two nations are already leading efforts to face up to this challenge, and we're making progress with Daesh losing territory and fighters, but we need to redouble our efforts. And today we are discussing how we can do this by deepening intelligence and security cooperation and, critically, by stepping up our efforts to counter Daesh in cyberspace. Because we know we will not eradicate this threat until we defeat the idea—the ideology that lies behind it.  Our talks will be continuing later. I'm sure we'll discuss other topics, Syria and Russia.  On defense and security cooperation, we are united in our recognition of NATO as the bulwark of our collective defense. And today we've reaffirmed our unshakeable commitment to this alliance. Mr. President, I think you said—you confirmed that you're a hundred percent behind NATO. But we're also discussing the importance of NATO continuing to ensure it is as equipped to fight terrorism and cyberwarfare as it is to fight more conventional forms of war.  And I've agreed to continue my efforts to encourage my fellow European leaders to deliver on their commitments to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense so that the burden is more fairly shared. It's only by investing properly in our defense that we can ensure we're properly equipped to face our shared challenges together.  And finally, the President and I have mentioned future economic cooperation and trade. Trade between our two countries is already worth over 150 billion pounds a year. The U.S. is the single biggest source of inward investment to the U.K., and together, we've around $1 trillion invested in each other's economies. And the U.K.-U.S. defense relationship is the broadest, deepest, and most advanced of any two countries sharing military hardware and expertise. And I think the President and I are ambitious to build on this relationship in order to grow our respective economies, provide the high-skilled, high-paid jobs of the future for working people across America and across the U.K.  And so we are discussing how we can establish a trade negotiation agreement, take forward immediate high-level talks, lay the groundwork for a U.K.-U.S. trade agreement, and identify the practical steps we can take now in order to enable companies in both countries to trade and do business with one another more easily.  And I'm convinced that a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. is in the national interest of both countries and will cement the crucial relationship that exists between us, particularly as the U.K. leaves the European Union and reaches out to the world.  Today's talks, I think, are a significant moment for President Trump and I to build our relationship. And I look forward to continuing to work with you as we deliver on the promises of freedom and prosperity for all the people of our respective countries. Thank you.  President Trump. Thank you very much. That's very nicely stated. Steve Holland [Reuters]. Where's Steve? Steve—yes.  Russia-U.S. Relations  Q. Thank you. You're going to be speaking tomorrow with the Russian President.  President Trump. Yes  Q. What message would you like to convey to him? How close are you to lifting some of the sanctions imposed on Russia over its Ukraine incursion? What would you expect in return? And Prime Minister May, do you foresee any changes in British attitudes towards sanctions on Russia?  President Trump. Well, I hear a call was set up, Steve, and we'll see what happens. As far as the sanctions, very early to be talking about that, but we look to have a great relationship with all countries, ideally. That won't necessarily happen, unfortunately, it probably won't happen with many countries, but if we can have, as we do with Prime Minister May and the relationship that we've all developed, and even in the short relationship that we've just developed just by being with each other—we're going to have lunch, and we've really had some very interesting talks and very productive talks—but if we can have a great relationship with Russia and with China and with all countries, I'm all for that. That would be a tremendous asset. No guarantees, but if we can, that would be a positive, not a negative. Okay?  Prime Minister May. We have—as far as the U.K. is concerned on sanctions for Russia in relation to their activities in the Ukraine—we have been very clear that we want to see the Minsk agreement fully implemented. We believe the sanctions should continue until we see that Minsk agreement fully implemented, and we've been continuing to argue that inside the European Union. Okay?  Laura.  Torture/President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia/Russia-U.S. Relations  Q. Thank you very much, Prime Minister. Laura Kuenssberg, BBC News. Prime Minister, you've talked about where you agree, but you have also said you would be frank where you disagree with the President. Can you tell us where in our talks you did disagree? And do you think that the President listened to what you had to say? And Mr. President——  President Trump. Absolutely. [Laughter]  Q. We'll see what she says. [Laughter] Mr. President, you've said before that torture works, you've praised Russia, you've said you want to ban some Muslims for coming—from coming to America, you've suggested there should be punishment for abortion. For many people in Britain, those sound like alarming beliefs. What do you say to our viewers at home who are worried about some of your views and worried about you becoming the leader of the free world?  President Trump. This was your choice of a question? [Laughter]  Prime Minister May. [Inaudible]—start off, yes. [Laughter]  President Trump. There goes that relationship. [Laughter]  Prime Minister May. On the issue that you raised with me, Laura, can I confirm that the President—I've been listening to the President, and the President has been listening to me. That's the point of having a conversation and a dialogue. And we have been discussing a number of topics. We'll carry on after this press conference, meeting and, kind of, discussing a number of other topics. And there will be times when we disagree and issues on which we disagree. The point of the special relationship is that we are able to have that open and frank discussion so that we are able to make that clear when it happens.  But I'm clear also that there are many issues on which the United Kingdom and the United States stand alongside one another, many issues on which we agree. And I think, as I said yesterday in my speech, that we are at a moment now when we can build an even stronger special relationship which will be in the interest not just of the U.K. and the United States, but actually in the interests of the wider world as well.  President Trump. Very good. We have a great general who has just been appointed Secretary of Defense, General James Mattis, and he has stated publicly that he does not necessarily believe in torture or waterboarding, or however you want to define it. Enhanced interrogation, I guess, would be a word that a lot of—words that a lot of people would like to use. I don't necessarily agree, but I would tell you that he will override, because I'm giving him that power. He's an expert. He's highly respected. He's the general's general—got through the Senate very, very quickly, which in this country is not easy, I will tell you. [Laughter] And so I'm going to rely on him. I happen to feel that it does work. I've been open about that for a long period of time, but I am going with our leaders. And we're going to win with or without, but I do disagree.  As far as, again, Putin and Russia, I don't say good, bad, or indifferent. I don't know the gentleman. I hope we have a fantastic relationship. That's possible, and it's also possible that we won't. We will see what happens. I will be representing the American people very, very strongly, very forcefully. And if we have a great relationship with Russia and other countries, and if we go after ISIS together, which has to be stopped—that's an evil that has to be stopped—I will consider that a good thing, not a bad thing.  How the relationship works out, I won't be able to tell you that later. I've had many times where I thought I'd get along with people, and I don't like them at all. [Laughter] And I've had some where I didn't think I was going to have much of a relationship, and it turned out to be a great relationship. So, Theresa, we never know about those things, do we? [Laughter] But I will tell you one thing, I'll be representing the American people very strongly. Thank you.  How about John Roberts, Fox.  The President's Phone Conversation With President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico/Mexico-U.S. Relations  Q. Mr. President, thank you so much. Madam Prime Minister.  President Trump. Thank you.  Q. It's my understanding, Mr. President, that you had an hour-long phone call this morning with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico. Could we get an update on where the relationship is? Further to that, what do you say to your critics who claim that you have already soured a relationship with a very important U.S. ally? And Madam Prime Minister, if I may ask you as well, are you concerned about the state of relations between the United States and Mexico? Sir.  President Trump. Well, I think the Prime Minister, first of all, has other things that she's much more worried about than Mexico and the United States relationship. But I will say that we had a very good call. I have been very strong on Mexico. I have great respect for Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I work with the Mexican people all the time, great relationships. But as you know, Mexico—with the United States—has outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders. They've made us look foolish. We have a trade deficit of $60 billion with Mexico. On top of that, the border is soft and weak, drugs are pouring in, and I'm not going to let that happen. And General Kelly is going to do a fantastic job at Homeland Security. As you know, we swore him in yesterday.  We have a really, I think, a very good relationship, the President and I, and we had a talk that lasted for about an hour this morning. And we are going to be working on a fair relationship and a new relationship. But the United States cannot continue to lose vast amounts of business, vast amounts of companies, and millions and millions of people losing their jobs. That won't happen with me. We're no longer going to be the country that doesn't know what it's doing. And so we are going to renegotiate our trade deals, and we are going to renegotiate other aspects of our relationship with Mexico. And in the end, I think it will be good for both countries.  But it was a very, very friendly call. I think you'll hear that from the President, and I think you'll hear that from the people of Mexico that really represent him and represent him very well. And I look forward to—over the coming months we'll be negotiating, and we'll see what happens. But I'm representing the people of the United States, and I'm going to represent them as somebody should represent them, not how they've been represented in the past, where we lose to every single country.  Prime Minister May. As the President himself has said, the relationship of the United States with Mexico is a matter for the United States and Mexico.  Tom [Tom N. Dunn, Sun].  The President's Relationship With Prime Minister May/United Kingdom Referendum Vote To Leave the European Union  Q. Mr. President, you've said you would help us with a Brexit trade deal. You said you'd stand by us with NATO, but how can the British Prime Minister believe you, because you have been known in the past to change your position on things? And also, may I ask a question to both of you? People are fascinated to know how you're going to get on with each other. You're so different: the hard-working daughter of a vicar, the brash TV extrovert. Have you found anything in common personally yet?  President Trump. Actually, I'm not as brash as you might think. [Laughter] And I can tell you that I think we're going to get along very well. You know, I've—interesting because I am a people person. I think you are also, Theresa. And I can often tell how I get along with somebody very early, and I believe we're going to have a fantastic relationship.  Brexit—and I really don't change my position very much. If you go back and you look, my position on trade has been solid for many, many years, since I was a very young person talking about how we were getting ripped off by the rest of the world. Now, I never knew I'd be in this position where we can actually do something about it. But we will be talking to your folks about Brexit. Brexit was an example of what was to come, and I happened to be in Scotland at Turnberry cutting a ribbon when Brexit happened. And we had a vast amount of press there. And I said Brexit—this was the day before, you probably remember—I said Brexit is going to happen. And I was scorned in the press for making that prediction. I was scorned. And I said I believe it's going to happen, because people want to know who's coming into their country, and they want to control their own trade and various other things. And lo and behold, the following day, it happened. And the odds weren't looking good for me when I made that statement, because as you know, everybody thought it was not going to happen.  I think Brexit's going to be a wonderful thing for your country. I think when it irons out, you're going to have your own identity, and you're going to have the people that you want in your country, and you're going to be able to make free trade deals without having somebody watching you and what you're doing. And I had a very bad experience. I have—I had something when I was in my other world. I have something in another country, and getting the approvals from Europe was very, very tough. Getting the approvals from the country was fast, easy, and efficient. Getting the approvals from the group—I call them the consortium—was very, very tough. But I thought Brexit—I think and I think it'll go down that it will end up being a fantastic thing for the United Kingdom. I think in the end it will be a tremendous asset, not a tremendous liability. Okay. Prime Minister. And just on the question you asked me, Tom. I mean, I think as the President himself has said, I think we have already struck up a good relationship. But you asked what we had in common. I think if you look at the approach that we're both taking, I think one of the things that we have in common is that we want to put the interests of ordinary working people right up there, center stage. Those people who, you know, they're working all the hours, they're doing their best for their families, and sometimes, they just feel the odds are stacked against them. And it's that interest in ensuring that what we do, that the economies—our economies and our governments actually work for ordinary working people—work for everyone in our countries. I think we both share that.  President Trump. Thank you very much.  Prime Minister May. Thank you.  President Trump. Thank you very much, everybody."
Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan,2017-02-10,"The bond between our two nations—and the friendship between our two peoples—runs very, very deep. This administration is committed to bringing those ties even closer. We are committed to the security of Japan and all areas under its administrative control and to further strengthening our very crucial alliance.  The U.S.-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Pacific region. It is important that both Japan and the United States continue to invest very heavily in the alliance to build up our defense and our defensive capabilities, which, under our mutual leadership, will become stronger and stronger, and as time goes by, ultimately, they will be impenetrable.  We face numerous challenges, and bilateral cooperation is essential. Our country is committed to being an active and fully engaged partner. We will work together to promote our shared interests, of which we have many in the region, including freedom from navigation and—of navigation and defending against the North Korean missile and nuclear threat, both of which I consider a very, very high priority.  On the economy, we will seek a trading relationship that is free, fair, and reciprocal, benefiting both of our countries. The vibrant exchange between us is a true blessing. Japan is a proud nation with a rich history and culture, and the American people have profound respect for your country and its traditions. I also want to take this opportunity, Mr. Prime Minister, to thank you and the people of Japan for hosting our Armed Forces.  Working together, our two countries have the ability to bring greater harmony, stability, and prosperity to the Pacific region and beyond, improving countless lives in the process. We are committed to that goal, highly committed.  Prime Minister Abe, on behalf of the United States of America, I thank you for being with us today. We will soon be traveling to the great State of Florida, where I know we will have a long and very successful talk, negotiations, and a very, very productive weekend.  Mr. Prime Minister.  Prime Minister Abe. This is the fourth time in 6 months for me to visit the United States. The last time was in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, at the end of last year. I am indeed sincerely grateful for the always heartwarming welcome accorded to me by the American people.  I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to President Trump. Donald, you must have been very busy in this very important period of 100 days after your Inauguration. And thank you very much for inviting me over to the White House. My name is Abe, but in the United States, some people mistakenly pronounce my name as ""Abe."" But that is not bad, because even in Japan, everybody knows the name of that great President, that farmer-carpenter's son can become a President. And that fact, 150 years ago, surprised the Japanese, who were still under the shogunate rule. The Japanese opened their eyes to democracy. The United States is the champion of democracy. Donald, President, you are excellent businessman, but you have never been in the Congress or been a Governor. You have not experienced being in the public office. But you have fought the uphill struggle and fight for more than a year in the election campaign to become a new President. And this is the dynamism of democracy. I would like to celebrate and congratulate Donald being sworn in as the President.  The United States is a country having the largest number of chances, opportunities in the world. That has always been the case right now, as well as going forward. This will never change. And that is the reason why automotive industries and other Japanese businesses have built factories all over the United States, to engage in local production here. Last year, from Japan to the United States, there have been more than $150 billion of new investment being made into the United States. And those Japanese businesses have created a large number of jobs. The mutually beneficial economic relations have been built by Japan and United States. With President Trump taking on the leadership, I'm sure there will be—major-scale infrastructure investment will be made, including the fast-speed train.  Those of you who have rode on the Japanese Shinkansen, I'm sure you would appreciate the speed, the comfort and safety with the latest mag-lev technology. From Washington, DC, to New York, where Trump Tower exists, only 1 hour would it take if you ride the maglev train from Washington, DC, here to New York. Japan, with our high level of technical capability, we will be able to contribute to President Trump's growth strategy. There will be even more new jobs being born in the United States.  And to further deepen these bilateral economic relations, between Deputy Prime Minister Aso and Vice President Pence there will be a cross-sectoral dialogue to be held. And we have agreed on this.  And furthermore, in Asia-Pacific, where we see dramatic growth to expand free trade and investment, this will be a big chance for both Japan and the United States. But of course, it must be done in a fair manner. Never should a state-owned company, backed by state capital, should not make any economic intervention. Free ride on intellectual property should not be condoned. In Asia-Pacific region, with Japan and U.S. taking on the leadership to create free and fair market based upon rules, should be built. I and President Trump has confirmed on our strong will to do so.  The cornerstone of peace and prosperity in Asia-Pacific, that is the strong Japan-U.S. alliance. And this is an unwavering ties between our two countries. I and President Trump will work together to further strengthen our alliance. We have shared this strong resolve.  As we see increasingly difficult security environment, we have confirmed that U.S.-Japan security pact article 5 will be applied to Senkaku Islands. The United States will strengthen its presence in the region. And under the banner of the proactive contribution to peace, Japan will play a greater role. At the same time, we will maintain the deterrence and also to proceed on reducing the impact we had a will—fought through on the realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan. And Henoko's—relocation to Henoko of the MCAS Futenma is the only solution. And Japan and U.S. will continue to work closely on this.  On North Korea, we had—would strongly demand North Korea to abandon nuclear and ballistic missile program and not to make any more provocations. And we have completely agreed on the importance of the early solution for the abduction issue. And East China Sea, South China Sea, and Indian Ocean—everywhere, we need to maintain the freedom of navigation and rule of law. And such international order there must be maintained.  Japan and United States have confirmed that we will strongly protest any use of force, as well as coercion to change the status quo. I and the President will address not only bilateral, but regional issues. And we have had a very frank exchange of views on the peace and prosperity of the world that we should contribute, for any form of terrorism should be strongly condemned. And we had—would cooperate in our fight against terrorism. Japan had—will, of course, exercise a commensurate role in this regard. And furthermore, the regional conflict, the refugees, poverty, and infectious diseases—there are many challenges faced by the world, which will be a serious issue to threaten the peace and stability for Japan as well as the United States.  But Japan and the United States and the international community must work hand in hand in order to solve these questions. Of course, there are disagreements, but we should not close down dialogue just by pointing to the differences and ignoring the common interests and common goals. We need to have a dialogue, because there are disagreements. What we mostly desire—what is most desired by those who are challenging the existing international order is to just focus on differences. We should not close the dialogue. Japan have for 4 years that—I have consistently followed through on our foreign policy.  Now, whatever the challenge and difficulty ahead of us, I and Trump—President Trump will continue our dialogue to seek shared solutions. And after lunch, I am looking forward for a weekend in Florida with Donald. We will play golf together. My scores in golf will—is not up to the level of Donald at all, but my policy is never up, never in, always aiming for the cup—never to adjust the goal with the shortcuts and short—chops. Those are the words never found in my dictionary. [Laughter]  But in a relaxed atmosphere, I hope to take time to discuss with Donald on the future of the world, future of the region, and future of Japan and United States.  Thank you.  President Trump. Thank you very much. We'll take a few questions, unless you don't want to ask any questions, if that's possible. [Laughter] Maybe we'll start—where is Daniel Halper, New York Post? Daniel.  Executive Order on Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm curious about yesterday's ruling in the 9th Circuit Court. Has it caused you to rethink your use of executive power? And how will you respond? And will you sign new Executive orders or perhaps a new travel ban?  And, Mr. Prime Minister, I'm curious about your reaction to America's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP. Do you think that that's weakened America's position in Asia? And how do you think—how do you envision any sort of trade deal with the President working out?  President Trump. Well, your question was unrelated to what we're here for today, but I'll answer it. We are going to keep our country safe; we are going to do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe. We had a decision which we think we'll be very successful with. It shouldn't have taken this much time, because safety is a primary reason. One of the reasons I'm standing here today is the security of our country. The voters felt that I would give it the best security. So we'll be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country. You'll be seeing that sometime next week.  In addition, we will continue to go through the court process, and ultimately, I have no doubt that we'll win that particular case.  Prime Minister Abe. Now, in the world, we are also facing the issues of the refugees and terrorism. We need to work closely together on these global issues. Japan have always played our own role, but going forward, we would continue to work with the international community to execute our responsibility in a commensurate manner. And each of our country has immigration control scheme, as well as policy on immigration, as well as refugees. These are to do with domestic affairs of that country, so I would refrain from making any comments.  President Trump. Okay. Blake Berman, Fox. Blake Berman.  Terrorism  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to pick up where Daniel left off, if you don't mind. You said earlier this week—and I'm quoting for you—you said, ""I've learned a lot in the last 2 weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand, but we're going to take care of it.""  Based off of what you have learned, and now knowing that your Executive order is at least temporarily on hold, do you still feel as confident now as you have been at any point, that you and the administration will be able to protect the homeland?  And, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you. I would just like to pick off again on what Daniel had asked about TPP. Do you feel it's a mistake that the United States has at least signaled its intention to withdraw from the deal? Thank you, both.  President Trump. I feel totally confident that we will have tremendous security for the people of the United States. We will be extreme vetting, which is a term that I developed early in my campaign because I saw what was happening. And while I've been President, which is just for a very short period of time, I've learned tremendous things that you could only learn, frankly, if you were in a certain position, namely, President. And there are tremendous threats to our country. We will not allow that to happen, I can tell you that right now. We will not allow that to happen.  So we'll be going forward. We'll be doing things to continue to make our country safe. It will happen rapidly. And we will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm to our people. We will allow lots of people into our country that will love our people and do good for our country. It's always going to be that way, at least during my administration, I can tell you that.  Prime Minister Abe. On TPP—oh, of course, we are fully aware of President Trump's decision. On economic issues, we will be discussing at the working lunch to follow. As for Japan and United States, trade and investment, as well as economic relations, how can we develop and grow our relationship? As I have already mentioned, Deputy Prime Minister Aso and Vice President Pence will create a new framework for dialogue, and I am quite optimistic that the good results will be seen from the dialogue.  Now, for the free and fair common set of rules to be created for the free trade regime in the region, and that was the purpose of TPP, and that—the importance have not changed. I, myself, believe that.  Job Creation/Manufacturing Industry/Japan-U.S. Relations  Q. Thank you. My name is Hara from NHK. I have a question to Prime Minister Abe. Now, for the automotive market in Japan, as well as foreign exchange of Japan, in the prior remarks there have been discrepancy in your positions. So at the summit meeting, what were the discussions? And were you able to narrow down the gap?  And President Trump had said that he will make the United States a great country. What is meant by the ""great country""? And, Prime Minister, what do you mean when you say United States is a great ally for you? Prime Minister Abe. Now with the birth of the Trump administration, a new genesis will be built between Japan and U.S. in economic relations. In order to put forward such strong message, I have proposed to launch a new framework for economic dialogue, and we were able to agree on this.  As for sectoral discussions, we will be having a discussion at our working lunch. In any case, between President Trump and I, myself, on Japan and U.S. economic relations, we will—we have already agreed that we will have Vice President Pence and Deputy Prime Minister Aso to discuss fully on the economic relations between our two countries. And we are looking forward for the good results to ensue from the debate between the experts. As for the foreign exchange, we will have—Secretary of Treasury and the Minister of Finance will continue the close communication.  For the United States to become a great nation, the various roles played by the United States and the responsibility to go with it, the world over is faced with increasing uncertainty. That United States will become a great America and become a great and strong ally would be good for Japan. And for Japan and U.S. alliance to be further strengthened would be good not only for our two nations, but also contribute to the peace and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific. And United States to become even greater, we will welcome that.  President Trump. Thank you. I will say that—and you've seen it—ever since I won the election and became President-elect, I've been telling companies—car companies and other companies—many companies: Come back into the United States. And they've been coming back in. And big announcements are going to be made over the next short period of time. Some of you already know what those announcements are.  We've lost a lot of our factories, a lot of our plants. And those factories and those plants will be coming back. And jobs will be coming back to Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and North Carolina and so many other places where we've lost so many jobs. And those are the people that were so good to me, and now I'm being good to them.  And so we've had a tremendous number of announcements. We've had Ford and General Motors and many, many others—Intel yesterday made a major announcement. And they did that because of what is happening with our tax structure, which is going along very well. And we'll be having some very big news over the next short period of time.  But we are a nation of tremendous potential. And the expression ""Make America Great Again,"" I will tell you—and I will add very strongly and with great assurety—it will be greater than ever before.  And I just want to thank the Prime Minister for a friendship. We developed a great friendship when we met in New York City at Trump Tower. We spoke for a long, long period of time. And when I greeted him today at the car, I was saying—I shook hands, but I grabbed him and hugged him because that's the way we feel. We have a very, very good bond, very, very good chemistry. I'll let you know if it changes, but I don't think it will. [Laughter]  So I just want to thank the Prime Minister for being here. We're going to be meeting your wife in a very short period of time, and I look very much forward to that.  And I want to thank everybody in the room. We're going to have a tremendous relationship, long-term relationship of mutual benefit with Japan.  Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.  Prime Minister Abe. One more.  President Trump. Yes, certainly. Okay, go ahead. China-U.S. Relations/Trade/Health Care Reform  Q. Thank you very much. From Sankei Shimbun, my name is Takita. I have a question to President Trump. Obama administration, under the rebalance to Asia, have emphasized Asia. But China is taking hardline stance in South China Sea, as well as China Sea. And North Korea has went on with the missiles and nuclear development. So some countries in Asia are concerned over commitment of United States in Asia. So, against this backdrop, as was mentioned earlier, for the Trump administration, for the situations in Asia, how would you respond to the increasing difficulty here?  And, President, you have repeatedly stated about China taking on the currency—foreign exchange policies which are not good for the United States. Do you think that eventually it will change in the future?  President Trump. I had a very, very good conversation, as most of you know, yesterday with the President of China. It was a very, very warm conversation. I think we are on the process of getting along very well. And I think that will also be very much of a benefit to Japan. So we had a very, very good talk last night and discussed a lot of subjects. It was a long talk. And we are working on that as we speak. We have conversations with various representatives of China. I believe that that will all work out very well for everybody: China, Japan, the United States, and everybody in the region.  As far as the currency devaluations, I've been complaining about that for a long time. And I believe that we will all eventually—and probably, very much sooner than a lot of people understand or think—we will be all at a level playing field, because that's the only way it's fair. That's the only way that you can fairly compete in trade and other things. And we will be on that field, and we will all be working very hard to do great for our country. But it has to be fair. And we will make it fair.  I think the United States is going to be an even bigger player than it is right now, by a lot, when it comes to trade. A lot of that will have to do with our tax policy, which you'll be seeing in the not-too-distant future. We'll have an incentive based policy much more so than we have right now. Right now we don't even know—nobody knows what policy we have. But we're going to have a very much incentive-based policy. We're working with Congress, working with Paul Ryan, working with Mitch McConnell. And I think people are going to be very, very impressed.  We're also working very much—and this has a lot to do with business—on health care, where we can get great health care for our country at a much-reduced price, both to the people receiving the health care and to our country. Because our country is paying so much, and Obamacare, as you know, is a total and complete disaster. So we're going to end up with tremendous health care at a lower price. And I think people are going to be extremely happy. Difficult process, but once we get going—and as you know, Tom Price was just approved a few hours ago. So we finally have our Secretary, and now we get down to the final strokes.  Again, I want to thank everybody for being here. I want to thank Mr. Prime Minister. What an honor, what a great honor it is. And let's go to Florida. [Laughter]"
Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada,2017-02-13,"Our two nations share much more than a border. We share the same values. We share the love—and a truly great love—of freedom. And we share a collective defense. American and Canadian troops have gone to battle together, fought wars together, and forged the special bonds that come when two nations have shed their blood together, which we have.  In these dangerous times, it is more important than ever that we continue to strengthen our vital alliance. The United States is deeply grateful for Canada's contribution to the counter-ISIS effort. Thank you. And we continue to work in common—and in common cause—against terrorism and work in common cooperation toward reciprocal trade and shared growth.  We understand that both of our countries are stronger when we join forces in matters of international commerce. Having more jobs and trade right here in North America is better for both the United States and is also much better for Canada. We should coordinate closely—and we will coordinate closely—to protect jobs in our hemisphere and keep wealth on our continent, and to keep everyone safe.  Prime Minister, I pledge to work with you in pursuit of our many shared interests. This includes a stronger trading relationship between the United States and Canada. It includes safe, efficient, and responsible cross-border travel and migration. And it includes close partnership on domestic and international security.  America is deeply fortunate to have a neighbor like Canada. We have before us the opportunity to build even more bridges and bridges of cooperation and bridges of commerce. Both of us are committed to bringing greater prosperity and opportunity to our people.  We just had a very productive meeting with women business leaders from the United States and Canada, where we discussed how to secure everything that we know the full power of women can do better than anybody else. We know that. I just want to say, Mr. Prime Minister, that I'm focused—and you're focused—on the important role women play in our economies. We must work to address the barriers faced by women and women entrepreneurs, including access to capital, access to markets, and very importantly, access to networks.  In our discussion today, we will focus on improving the ways our Government and our governments together can benefit citizens of both the United States and Canada and, in so doing, advance the greater peace and stability of the world.  Mr. Prime Minister, I look forward to working closely with you to build upon our very historic friendship. There are incredible possibilities for us to pursue, Canada and the United, States together. Again, thank you for joining us, and I know our discussions will be very, very productive for the future of both countries.  Mr. Prime Minister.  Prime Minister Trudeau. Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you very much for joining us.  I'd first like to start by extending my sincere thanks to President Trump for inviting me down to Washington. Any day I get to visit our southern neighbors is a good day in my book, particularly when it's so nice and warm compared to what it is back home. We are suffering under a significant winter storm that's hitting our Atlantic Provinces particularly harsh, so I just want to send everyone back at home my thoughts as they shovel out and impress on everyone to stay safe.  [At this point, Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  The President and myself have had a very productive first meeting today. We had the opportunity to get to know one another better, and more importantly, we had the opportunity to talk about the unique relationship between Canada and the United States.  [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]  [Inaudible]—friends on both sides of the 49th parallel have understood that the bond between our nations is a special one. No other neighbors in the entire world are as fundamentally linked as we are. We've fought in conflict zones together, negotiated environmental treaties together, including 1991's historic Air Quality Agreement. And we've entered into groundbreaking economic partnerships that have created good jobs for both of our peoples.  Canadians and Americans alike share a common history as well as people-to-people ties that make us completely and totally integrated. Our workers are connected by trade, transportation, and cross-border commerce. Our communities rely on each other for security, stability, and economic prosperity. Our families have long lived together and worked together. We know that, more often than not, our victories are shared. And just as we celebrate together, so too do we suffer loss and heartbreak together.  Through it all, the foundational pillar upon which our relationship is built is one of mutual respect. And that's a good thing, because as we know, relationships between neighbors are pretty complex, and we won't always agree on everything. But because of our deep, abiding respect for one another, we're able to successfully navigate those complexities and still remain the closest of allies and friends. Make no mistake: At the end of the day, Canada and the U.S. will always remain each other's most essential partner.  And today's conversations have served to reinforce how important that is for both Canadians and Americans. As we know, 35 U.S. States list Canada as their largest export market, and our economies benefit from the over $2 billion in two-way trade that takes place every single day. Millions of good, middle class jobs on both sides of the border depend on this crucial partnership. Maintaining strong economic ties is vital to our mutual success, and we're going to continue to work closely together over the coming years so that Canadian and American families can get ahead. [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  As we know, 35 U.S. States list Canada as their largest export market, and our economies benefit from the over $2 billion in two-way trade that takes place every single day.

Maintaining strong economic ties is vital to our mutual success, and we're going to continue to work closely together over the coming years so that Canadian and American families can get ahead.  [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]  I'd like to highlight just a few of the specifics that President Trump and I discussed today. At the end of the day, the President and I share a common goal. We both want to make sure that hard-working folks can go to work at a good job, put food on the table for their families, and save up to take a vacation every once in a while. That's what we're trying to do here.  Today we reiterated that our nations are committed to collaborating on energy infrastructure projects that will create jobs while respecting the environment. And as we know, investing in infrastructure is a great way to create the kind of economic growth that our countries so desperately need.  In that same vein, we know that ensuring equal opportunities for women in the workforce is essential for growing the economy and maintaining American and Canadian competitiveness on the world stage. As such, the President and I have agreed to the creation of the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. This initiative is more than just about dollars and cents. This is about ensuring that women have access to the same opportunities as men and prioritizing the support and empowerment of women who are senior business leaders and entrepreneurs. In doing so, we'll grow the Canadian and American economies and help our businesses prosper.  [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  Finally, President Trump and myself have agreed to work together to fight against the traffic of opioids across our border. The rise of illegal use of opioids in our society is nothing less than a tragedy. We will do everything we can to ensure the safety of Canadians and Americans.  Ladies and gentlemen, President Trump: I know that if our countries continue to work together, our people will greatly benefit from this cooperation.  [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]  History has demonstrated time and again that in order to tackle our most pressing issues, both foreign and domestic, we must work with our closest allies, learn from each other, and stand in solidarity as a united voice.  With a level of economic and social integration that is unmatched on the world stage, Canada and the United States will forever be a model example of how to be good neighbors. Winston Churchill once said, ""That long Canadian frontier from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans, guarded only by neighborly respect and honorable obligations, is an example to every country and a pattern for the future of the world."" That, my friends, is the very essence of the Canada-U.S. relationship.  I look forward to working with President Trump over the coming years to nurture and build upon this historic partnership. Once again, it's a tremendous pleasure to be here in Washington. Merci beaucoup.  President Trump. Okay, we'll take a couple of questions. Scott Thuman [WJLA, Sinclair Broadcasting Group]. Scott.  Canada-U.S. Relations  Q. Thank you, Mr. President.  President Trump. Thank you.  Q. You just spoke about the desire to build bridges, although there are some notable and philosophical differences between yourself and Prime Minister Trudeau. I'm curious, as you move forward on issues from trade to terrorism, how do you see this relationship playing out? And are there any specific areas with which during your conversations today you each decided to perhaps alter or amend your stances already on those sensitive issues like terrorism and immigration?  And, Prime Minister Trudeau, while only in its infancy so far, how do you see this relationship compared to that under the Obama administration?  President Trump. Well, we just began discussions. We are going to have a great relationship with Canada, maybe as good or better, hopefully, than ever before. We have some wonderful ideas on immigration. We have some, I think, very strong, very tough ideas on the tremendous problem that we have with terrorism. And I think when we put them all together, which will be very, very quickly—we have a group of very talented people—we will see some very, very obvious results. We're also doing some cross-border things that will make it a lot easier for trade and a lot better and a lot faster for trade.  We have—through technology, we have some really great ideas, and they'll be implemented fairly quickly.  Prime Minister Trudeau. One of the things we spoke about was the fact that security and immigration need to work very well together. And certainly, Canada has emphasized security as we look towards improving our immigration system and remaining true to the values that we have. And we had a very strong and fruitful discussion on exactly that.  There's plenty that we can draw on each other from in terms of how we move forward with a very similar goal, which is to create free, open societies that keep our citizens safe. And that's certainly something that we're very much in agreement on.  Tonda MacCharles [Toronto Star].  Immigration  Q. Good afternoon, Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister. And, Mr. Prime Minister, could you answer in English and French for us, please?  A little bit of a follow-on on my American colleague's question. President Trump, you seem to suggest that Syrian refugees are a Trojan horse for potential terrorism, while the Prime Minister hugs refugees and welcomes them with open arms. So I'd like to know, are you confident the northern border is secure? President Trump. You can never be totally confident. But through the incredible efforts—already, I see it happening—of formerly General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, we have really done a great job. We're actually taking people that are criminals—very, very hardened criminals in some cases, with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems—and we're getting them out. And that's what I said I would do. I'm just doing what I said I would do when we won by a very, very large electoral college vote.  And I knew that was going to happen. I knew this is what people were wanting. And that wasn't the only reason, that wasn't my only thing that we did so well on. But that was something was very important. And I said we will get the criminals out, the drug lords, the gang members. We're getting them out.  General Kelly, who is sitting right here, is doing a fantastic job. And I said at the beginning, we are going to get the bad ones—the really bad ones, we're getting them out. And that's exactly what we're doing.  I think that in the end everyone is going to be extremely happy. And I will tell you right now, a lot of people are very, very happy right now.  Prime Minister Trudeau. Canada has always understood that keeping Canadians safe is one of the fundamental responsibilities of any government. And that's certainly something that we're very much focused on.  At the same time, we continue to pursue our policies of openness towards immigration, refugees, without compromising security. And part of the reason we're—we have been successful in doing that over the past year—welcoming close to 40,000 Syrian refugees—is because we have been coordinating with our allies, the United States and around the world, to demonstrate that security comes very seriously to us. And that's something that we continue to deal with.  [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  It is clear that if you want to have a healthy and secure society or safe society, you have to make sure that you maintain—that you focus on security. And we have welcomed refugees from Syria. We have been very successful, but we have always taken our responsibility toward security very seriously. And our allies, including the United States, understand this focus very well. And they have done so since the very beginning.  President Trump. Kaitlan Collins [Daily Caller], please.  U.S. National Security/North Korea/Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan/Immigration  Q. Thank you. President Trump, now that you've been in office and received intelligence briefings for nearly 1 month, what do you see as the most important national security matters facing us?  And, Prime Minister Trudeau, you've made very clear that Canada has an open-door policy for Syrian refugees. Do you believe that President Trump's moratorium on immigration has merit on national security grounds?  President Trump. Okay. Thank you. Many, many problems. When I was campaigning, I said it's not a good situation. Now that I see it—including with our intelligence briefings—we have problems that a lot of people have no idea how bad they are, how serious they are, not only internationally, but when you come right here. Well, I mean, obviously, North Korea is a big, big problem, and we will deal with that very strongly. We have problems all over the Middle East. We have problems just about every corner of the globe, no matter where you look. I had a great meeting this weekend with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and got to know each other very, very well—extended weekend, really. We were with each other for long periods of time and our staffs and representatives.  But on the home front, we have to create borders. We have to let people that can love our country in, and I want to do that. We want to have a big, beautiful, open door, and we want people to come in and come in our country. But we cannot let the wrong people in, and I will not allow that to happen during this administration. And people—citizens of our country—want that, and that's their attitude too, I will tell you.  We are getting such praise for our stance, and it's a stance of common sense—maybe a certain toughness, but it's really more than toughness, it's a stance of common sense—and we are going to pursue it vigorously. And we don't want to have our country have the kinds of problems that you're witnessing taking place not only here, but all over the world. We won't stand for it. We won't put up for—with it. We're just not going to let it happen. We're going to give ourselves every bit of chance so that things go well for the United States. And they will go well. Thank you.  Prime Minister Trudeau. Canada and the United States have been neighbors a long time, and Canadians and Americans have stood together, worked together at home and around the world. We've fought and died together in battlefields in World War I and World War II, in Korea, in Afghanistan. But there have been times where we have differed in our approaches, and that's always been done firmly and respectfully.  The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves. My role, our responsibility, is to continue to govern in such a way that reflects Canadians' approach and be a positive example in the world.  President Trump. Okay.  Prime Minister Trudeau. Richard Latendresse [Groupe TVA].  Canada-U.S. Trade/Mexico-U.S. Trade/Job Creation  Q. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. I'll ask my question in French first, and then, for you, I'll get—again in English.  [The reporter spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  Mr. Prime Minister, if I heard you correctly, you said that Canadian businesses, Canadian workers are concerned for their businesses and for their work and jobs concerning the renegotiation of NAFTA. So what guarantees did you get from this government that we will keep our jobs and our businesses in the renegotiation of NAFTA?  [The reporter spoke in English as follows.]  Mr. President, again, during the last 3 months, you have denounced NAFTA. You have talked over and over about the Mexican portion of the agreement, very little about the Canadian one. My questions in two short part is, is Canada a fair trader? And when you talk about changes to NAFTA concerning Canada, are we again—are you talking about big changes or small changes? Thank you.  [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  Prime Minister Trudeau. First of all, Richard, thank you for your question. It is a real concern for many Canadians because we know that our economy is very dependent on our bonds, our relationship with the United States. Goods and services do cross the border each way every single day, and this means a lot of millions of jobs for Canadians and good jobs for Canadians. So we are always focusing on these jobs, but there are also good jobs, millions of jobs, in the United States that depend on those relationships between our two countries.  So when we sit down as we did today, and as our teams will be doing in the weeks and months to come, we will be talking about how we can continue to create good jobs for our citizens on both sides of the border. And during this exercise, we continue to understand that we have to allow this free flow of goods and services, and we have to be aware of the integration of our economies, which is extremely positive for both our countries. And this is the focus that we will have in the coming weeks and months to come.  [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]  Canadians are rightly aware of the fact that much of our economy depends on good working relationships with the United States, a good integration with the American economy. And the fact is, millions of good jobs on both sides of the border depend on the smooth and easy flow of goods and services and people back and forth across our border.  And both President Trump and I got elected on commitments to support the middle class, to work hard for people who need a real shot at success. And we know that by working together, by ensuring the continued effective integration of our two economies, we are going to be creating greater opportunities for middle class Canadians and Americans now and well into the future.  President Trump. I agree with that a hundred percent. We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada. We'll be tweaking it. We'll be doing certain things that are going to benefit both of our countries. It's a much less severe situation than what's taken place on the southern border. On the southern border, for many, many years, the transaction was not fair to the United States. It was an extremely unfair transaction. We're going to work with Mexico; we're going to make it a fair deal for both parties. I think that we're going to get along very well with Mexico; they understand, and we understand.  You probably have noticed that Ford is making billions of dollars of new investments in this country. You saw Intel the other day announce that because of what I've been doing and what I'm doing in terms of regulation—lowering taxes, et cetera—they're coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment and thousands of thousands of jobs. General Motors, likewise, is expanding plants and going to build new plants. Fiat Chrysler was at a meeting where they're doing the same. Jack Ma—we have so many people that want to come into the United States. It's actually very exciting.  I think it's going to be a very exciting period of time for the United States and for the workers of the United States, because they have been truly the forgotten man and forgotten women. It's not going to be forgotten anymore, believe me.  So our relationship with Canada is outstanding, and we're going to work together to make it even better. And as far as the southern border is concerned, we're going to get that worked  out. We're going to make it fair, but we are going to make it so that everybody is happy. It's very important to me.  Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much."
Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel,2017-02-15,"The state of Israel is a symbol to the world of resilience in the face of oppression -- I can think of no other state that's gone through what they've gone -- and of survival in the face of genocide. We will never forget what the Jewish people have endured.  Your perseverance in the face of hostility, your open democracy in the face of violence, and your success in the face of tall odds is truly inspirational. The security challenges faced by Israel are enormous, including the threat of Iran's nuclear ambitions, which I've talked a lot about. One of the worst deals I've ever seen is the Iran deal. My administration has already imposed new sanctions on Iran, and I will do more to prevent Iran from ever developing -- I mean ever -- a nuclear weapon. Our security assistance to Israel is currently at an all-time high, ensuring that Israel has the ability to defend itself from threats of which there are unfortunately many. Both of our countries will continue and grow. We have a long history of cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the fight against those who do not value human life. America and Israel are two nations that cherish the value of all human life. This is one more reason why I reject unfair and one-sided actions against Israel at the United Nations -- just treated Israel, in my opinion, very, very unfairly -- or other international forums, as well as boycotts that target Israel. Our administration is committed to working with Israel and our common allies in the region towards greater security and stability. That includes working toward a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. The United States will encourage a peace and, really, a great peace deal. We'll be working on it very, very diligently. Very important to me also -- something we want to do. But it is the parties themselves who must directly negotiate such an agreement. We'll be beside them; we'll be working with them. As with any successful negotiation, both sides will have to make compromises. You know that, right? (Laughter.)  PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Both sides. PRESIDENT TRUMP: I want the Israeli people to know that the United States stands with Israel in the struggle against terrorism. As you know, Mr. Prime Minister, our two nations will always condemn terrorist acts. Peace requires nations to uphold the dignity of human life and to be a voice for all of those who are endangered and forgotten.  Those are the ideals to which we all, and will always, aspire and commit. This will be the first of many productive meetings. And I, again, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much for being with us today.  Mr. Prime Minister, thank you. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: President Trump, thank you for the truly warm hospitality you and Melania have shown me, my wife Sara, our entire delegation. I deeply value your friendship. To me, to the state of Israel, it was so clearly evident in the words you just spoke -- Israel has no better ally than the United States. And I want to assure you, the United States has no better ally than Israel. Our alliance has been remarkably strong, but under your leadership I'm confident it will get even stronger. I look forward to working with you to dramatically upgrade our alliance in every field -- in security, in technology, in cyber and trade, and so many others. And I certainly welcome your forthright call to ensure that Israel is treated fairly in international forums, and that the slander and boycotts of Israel are resisted mightily by the power and moral position of the United States of America. As you have said, our alliance is based on a deep bond of common values and common interests. And, increasingly, those values and interests are under attack by one malevolent force: radical Islamic terror. Mr. President, you've shown great clarity and courage in confronting this challenge head-on. You call for confronting Iran's terrorist regime, preventing Iran from realizing this terrible deal into a nuclear arsenal. And you have said that the United States is committed to preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons. You call for the defeat of ISIS. Under your leadership, I believe we can reverse the rising tide of radical Islam. And in this great task, as in so many others, Israel stands with you and I stand with you. Mr. President, in rolling back militant Islam, we can seize an historic opportunity -- because, for the first time in my lifetime, and for the first time in the life of my country, Arab countries in the region do not see Israel as an enemy, but, increasingly, as an ally. And I believe that under your leadership, this change in our region creates an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen security and advance peace. Let us seize this moment together. Let us bolster security. Let us seek new avenues of peace. And let us bring the remarkable alliance between Israel and the United States to even greater heights.  Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you. Again, thank you.  We'll take a couple of questions. David Brody, Christian Broadcasting. David. Q: Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister. Both of you have criticized the Iran nuclear deal, and at times even called for its repeal. I'm wondering if you're concerned at all as it relates to not just the National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, who is recently no longer here, but also some of those events that have been going on with communication in Russia -- if that is going to hamper this deal at all, and whether or not it would keep Iran from becoming a nuclear state.  And secondly, on the settlement issue, are you both on the same page? How do you exactly term that as it relates to the settlement issue? Thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Michael Flynn, General Flynn is a wonderful man. I think he's been treated very, very unfairly by the media -- as I call it, the fake media, in many cases. And I think it's really a sad thing that he was treated so badly. I think, in addition to that, from intelligence -- papers are being leaked, things are being leaked. It's criminal actions, criminal act, and it's been going on for a long time -- before me. But now it's really going on, and people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton.  I think it's very, very unfair what's happened to General Flynn, the way he was treated, and the documents and papers that were illegally -- I stress that -- illegally leaked. Very, very unfair. As far as settlements, I'd like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. We'll work something out. But I would like to see a deal be made. I think a deal will be made. I know that every President would like to. Most of them have not started until late because they never thought it was possible. And it wasn't possible because they didn't do it. But Bibi and I have known each other a long time -- a smart man, great negotiator. And I think we're going to make a deal. It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand. That's a possibility. So let's see what we do. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Let's try it. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Doesn't sound too optimistic, but -- (laughter) -- he's a good negotiator. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: That's the ""art of the deal."" (Laughter.)  PRESIDENT TRUMP: I also want to thank -- I also want to thank -- Sara, could you please stand up? You're so lovely and you've been so nice to Melania. I appreciate it very much. (Applause.) Thank you.  Your turn. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Yes, please. Go ahead. Q: Thank you very much. Mr. President, in your vision for the new Middle East peace, are you ready to give up the notion of two-state solution that was adopted by previous administration? And will you be willing to hear different ideas from the Prime Minister, as some of his partners are asking him to do, for example, annexation of parts of the West Bank and unrestricted settlement constructions? And one more question: Are you going to fulfill your promise to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem? And if so, when? And, Mr. Prime Minister, did you come here tonight to tell the President that you're backing off the two-state solution? Thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP: So I'm looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like. (Laughter.) I'm very happy with the one that both parties like. I can live with either one.  I thought for a while the two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two. But honestly, if Bibi and if the Palestinians -- if Israel and the Palestinians are happy, I'm happy with the one they like the best.  As far as the embassy moving to Jerusalem, I'd love to see that happen. We're looking at it very, very strongly. We're looking at it with great care -- great care, believe me. And we'll see what happens. Okay? PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Thank you. I read yesterday that an American official said that if you ask five people what two states would look like, you'd get eight different answers. Mr. President, if you ask five Israelis, you'd get 12 different answers. (Laughter.) But rather than deal with labels, I want to deal with substance. It's something I've hoped to do for years in a world that's absolutely fixated on labels and not on substance. So here's the substance: There are two prerequisites for peace that I laid out two years -- several years ago, and they haven't changed. First, the Palestinians must recognize the Jewish state. They have to stop calling for Israel's destruction. They have to stop educating their people for Israel's destruction. Second, in any peace agreement, Israel must retain the overriding security control over the entire area west of the Jordan River. Because if we don't, we know what will happen -- because otherwise we'll get another radical Islamic terrorist state in the Palestinian areas exploding the peace, exploding the Middle East. Now, unfortunately, the Palestinians vehemently reject both prerequisites for peace. First, they continue to call for Israel's destruction -- inside their schools, inside their mosques, inside the textbooks. You have to read it to believe it.  They even deny, Mr. President, our historical connection to our homeland. And I suppose you have to ask yourself: Why do - - why are Jews called Jews? Well, the Chinese are called Chinese because they come from China. The Japanese are called Japanese because they come from Japan. Well, Jews are called Jews because they come from Judea. This is our ancestral homeland. Jews are not foreign colonialists in Judea. So, unfortunately, the Palestinians not only deny the past, they also poison the present. They name public squares in honor of mass murderers who murdered Israelis, and I have to say also murdered Americans. They fund -- they pay monthly salaries to the families of murderers, like the family of the terrorist who killed Taylor Force, a wonderful young American, a West Point graduate, who was stabbed to death while visiting Israel. So this is the source of the conflict -- the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize the Jewish state in any boundary; this persistent rejection. That's the reason we don't have peace. Now, that has to change. I want it to change. Not only have I not abandoned these two prerequisites of peace; they've become even more important because of the rising tide of fanaticism that has swept the Middle East and has also, unfortunately, infected Palestinian society. So I want this to change. I want those two prerequisites of peace -- substance, not labels -- I want them reinstated. But if anyone believes that I, as Prime Minister of Israel, responsible for the security of my country, would blindly walk into a Palestinian terrorist state that seeks the destruction of my country, they're gravely mistaken.  The two prerequisites of peace -- recognition of the Jewish state, and Israel's security needs west of the Jordan -- they remain pertinent. We have to look for new ways, new ideas on how to reinstate them and how to move peace forward. And I believe that the great opportunity for peace comes from a regional approach from involving our newfound Arab partners in the pursuit of a broader peace and peace with the Palestinians.  And I greatly look forward to discussing this in detail with you, Mr. President, because I think that if we work together, we have a shot. PRESIDENT TRUMP: And we have been discussing that, and it is something that is very different, hasn't been discussed before. And it's actually a much bigger deal, a much more important deal, in a sense. It would take in many, many countries and it would cover a very large territory. So I didn't know you were going to be mentioning that, but that's -- now that you did, I think it's a terrific thing and I think we have some pretty good cooperation from people that in the past would never, ever have even thought about doing this. So we'll see how that works out. Katie from Townhall. Where's Katie? Right there. Katie. Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You said in your earlier remarks that both sides will have to make compromises when it comes to a peace deal. You've mentioned a halt on settlements. Can you lay out a few more specific compromises that you have in mind, both for the Israelis and for the Palestinians?  And, Mr. Prime Minister, what expectations do you have from the new administration about how to either amend the Iran nuclear agreement or how to dismantle it altogether, and how to overall work with the new administration to combat Iran's increased aggression, not only in the last couple of months but the past couple of years as well? PRESIDENT TRUMP: It's actually an interesting question. I think that the Israelis are going to have to show some flexibility, which is hard, it's hard to do. They're going to have to show the fact that they really want to make a deal. I think our new concept that we've been discussing actually for a while is something that allows them to show more flexibility than they have in the past because you have a lot bigger canvas to play with. And I think they'll do that.  I think they very much would like to make a deal or I wouldn't be happy and I wouldn't be here and I wouldn't be as optimistic as I am. I really think they -- I can tell you from the standpoint of Bibi and from the standpoint of Israel, I really believe they want to make a deal and they'd like to see the big deal. I think the Palestinians have to get rid of some of that hate that they're taught from a very young age. They're taught tremendous hate. I've seen what they're taught. And you can talk about flexibility there too, but it starts at a very young age and it starts in the school room. And they have to acknowledge Israel -- they're going to have to do that. There's no way a deal can be made if they're not ready to acknowledge a very, very great and important country. And I think they're going to be willing to do that also. But now I also believe we're going to have, Katie, other players at a very high level, and I think it might make it easier on both the Palestinians and Israel to get something done. Okay? Thank you. Very interesting question. Thank you. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: You asked about Iran. One thing is preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons -- something that President Trump and I think are deeply committed to do. And we are obviously going to discuss that.  I think, beyond that, President Trump has led a very important effort in the past few weeks, just coming into the presidency. He pointed out there are violations, Iranian violations on ballistic missile tests. By the way, these ballistic missiles are inscribed in Hebrew, ""Israel must be destroyed."" The Palestinian -- rather the Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif said, well, our ballistic missiles are not intended against any country. No. They write on the missile in Hebrew, ""Israel must be destroyed.""  So challenging Iran on its violations of ballistic missiles, imposing sanctions on Hezbollah, preventing them, making them pay for the terrorism that they foment throughout the Middle East and beyond, well beyond -- I think that's a change that is clearly evident since President Trump took office. I welcome that. I think it's -- let me say this very openly: I think it's long overdue, and I think that if we work together -- and not just the United States and Israel, but so many others in the region who see eye to eye on the great magnitude and danger of the Iranian threat, then I think we can roll back Iran's aggression and danger. And that's something that is important for Israel, the Arab states, but I think it's vitally important for America. These guys are developing ICBMs. They're developing -- they want to get to a nuclear arsenal, not a bomb, a hundred bombs. And they want to have the ability to launch them everywhere on Earth, and including, and especially, eventually, the United States.  So this is something that is important for all of us. I welcome the change, and I intend to work with President Trump very closely so that we can thwart this danger. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Great. Do you have somebody? PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Moav (ph)? Q: Mr. President, since your election campaign and even after your victory, we've seen a sharp rise in anti-Semitic incidents across the United States. And I wonder what you say to those among the Jewish community in the States, and in Israel, and maybe around the world who believe and feel that your administration is playing with xenophobia and maybe racist tones. And, Mr. Prime Minister, do you agree to what the President just said about the need for Israel to restrain or to stop settlement activity in the West Bank? And a quick follow-up on my friend's questions -- simple question: Do you back off from your vision to the end of the conflict of two-state solution as you laid out in Bar-Ilan speech, or you still support it? Thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had -- 306 Electoral College votes. We were not supposed to crack 220. You know that, right? There was no way to 221, but then they said there's no way to 270. And there's tremendous enthusiasm out there.  I will say that we are going to have peace in this country. We are going to stop crime in this country. We are going to do everything within our power to stop long-simmering racism and every other thing that's going on, because lot of bad things have been taking place over a long period of time.  I think one of the reasons I won the election is we have a very, very divided nation. Very divided. And, hopefully, I'll be able to do something about that. And, you know, it was something that was very important to me. As far as people -- Jewish people -- so many friends, a daughter who happens to be here right now, a son-in-law, and three beautiful grandchildren. I think that you're going to see a lot different United States of America over the next three, four, or eight years. I think a lot of good things are happening, and you're going to see a lot of love. You're going to see a lot of love. Okay? Thank you. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: I believe that the issue of the settlements is not the core of the conflict, nor does it really drive the conflict. I think it's an issue, it has to be resolved in the context of peace negotiations. And I think we also are going to speak about it, President Trump and I, so we can arrive at an understanding so we don't keep on bumping into each other all the time on this issue. And we're going to discuss this. On the question you said, you just came back with your question to the problem that I said. It's the label. What does Abu Mazen mean by two states, okay? What does he mean? A state that doesn't recognize the Jewish state? A state that basically is open for attack against Israel? What are we talking about? Are we talking about Costa Rica, or are we talking about another Iran? So obviously it means different things. I told you what are the conditions that I believe are necessary for an agreement: It's the recognition of the Jewish state and it's Israel's -- Israel's -- security control of the entire area. Otherwise we're just fantasizing. Otherwise we'll get another failed state, another terrorist Islamist dictatorship that will not work for peace but work to destroy us but also destroy any hope -- any hope -- for a peaceful future for our people.  So I've been very clear about those conditions, and they haven't changed. I haven't changed. If you read what I said eight years ago, it's exactly that. And I repeated that again, and again, and again. If you want to deal with labels, deal with labels. I'll deal with substance. And finally, if I can respond to something that I know from personal experience. I've known President Trump for many years, and to allude to him, or to his people -- his team, some of whom I've known for many years, too. Can I reveal, Jared, how long we've known you? (Laughter.) Well, he was never small. He was always big. He was always tall.  But I've known the President and I've known his family and his team for a long time, and there is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump. I think we should put that to rest. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. Very nice. I appreciate that very much. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Thank you."
Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference,2017-02-16,"And also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved -- weeks late, I have to say that. Weeks, weeks late. Office of Management and Budget. And he will be, I think, a fantastic addition. Paul Singer has just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump, or, as they say, ""Never Trump."" And Paul just left and he's given us his total support. And it's all about unification. We're unifying the party, and hopefully we're going to be able to unify the country. It's very important to me. I've been talking about that for a long time, but it's very, very important to me. So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally. And I appreciate that. I think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions. And I had this time -- we've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible. Just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we've done some really good work. We're very proud of that.  And then right after that, you prepare yourselves and we'll do some questions -- unless you have no questions. That's always a possibility.  I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don't think there's ever been a President elected who, in this short period of time, has done what we've done.  A new Rasmussen poll, in fact -- because the people get it; much of the media doesn't get it. They actually get it, but they don't write it -- let's put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is -- to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, oh, that's good. Now it means that's good for jobs. Very different. Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States and big league -- Ford, General Motors, so many of them.  I'm making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which is an honor to have you this morning, because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible. Maybe it's not, and that's okay too.  Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people -- tremendous disservice. We have to talk about it to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control. I ran for President to represent the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure, we're talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort -- not all the time -- and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they're honest and fantastic. But much of it is not -- the distortion. And we'll talk about it, and you'll be able to ask me questions about it. But we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here again to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess -- it's a mess -- at home and abroad. A mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country. You see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places -- low-pay, low-wages. Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East, a disaster. North Korea -- we'll take care of it, folks. We're going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know I inherited a mess.  Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders -- much of it you've covered -- to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many. We've had great conversations with the United Kingdom -- and meetings -- Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada. Really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand. We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women's business leaders and entrepreneurs. It's very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka.  I have directed our defense community, headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis -- he's over there now, working very hard -- to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, and now it's in large sections of the world. They've spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer. Another mess I inherited.  And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who's totally taken advantage of our previous administration. And they're the world's top sponsor of terrorism. And we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it's not properly solved now. It's one of the worst agreements I've ever seen drawn by anybody.  I've ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. I've had great support from the Senate. I've had great support from Congress generally. We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military. And I will tell you that is my -- I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment. And their equipment is old. I used it, I talked about it at every stop. Depleted -- it's depleted. It won't be depleted for long.  And I think one of the reasons I'm standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military. We have to have strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war. We really are searching for peace, but it's peace through strength.  At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I'm keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders. Well, that's what I've been talking about for a year and a half -- strong borders. They're so surprised -- ""oh, you're having strong borders."" Well, that's what I've been talking about to the press and to everybody else.  One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lie to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I'm doing probably aren't popular, but they're necessary for security and for other reasons. And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians. I'm here following through on what I pledged to do. That's all I'm doing. I put it out before the American people. Got 306 Electoral College votes. I wasn't supposed to get 222. They said there's no way to get 222; 230 is impossible. Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before. So that's the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.  In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they're not happy about it for whatever reason. But a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I'll be in Melbourne, Florida, five o'clock on Saturday, and I heard -- just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there.  I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos. Chaos! Yet, it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my Cabinet approved, and they're outstanding people. Like Senator Dan Coates whose there -- one of the most respected men of the Senate -- he can't get approved. How do you not approve him? He's been a colleague, highly respected -- brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it -- but waiting for approval. So we have a wonderful group of people that's working very hard, that's being very much misrepresented about, and we can't let that happen. So if the Democrats, who have -- all you have to do is look at where they are right now -- the only thing they can do is delay, because they've screwed things up royally, believe me.  Let me list to you some of the things that we've done in just a short period of time. I just got here. I got here with no Cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people. So we'll go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming. We've withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership. We're going to make trade deals, but we're going to have one-on-one deals -- bilateral. We're going to have one-on-one deals. We've directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing, and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, and that means plants, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit -- it's many, many years. And then at the end of the process -- they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense -- and at the end of the process, they get rejected. Now, they may be rejected with me, but it's going to be a quick rejection. It's not going to take years. But mostly, it's going to be an acceptance. We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs. We don't want the jobs going to other countries.  We've imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers. We've imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations. We've issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody has ever seen regulations like we have. If you go to other countries and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations, and they're a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It's very important to me. But you don't need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing. We've stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation -- take a look at Chicago and others -- taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible. We've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We're becoming a drug-infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars, and we're not going to let it happen any longer.  We've undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe, and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border. Met with General, now Secretary, Kelly yesterday and we're starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it's going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else I've negotiated for the government. And we're going to have a wall that works. We're not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke.  We've ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we've ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release, no matter who you are -- release. We've begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day. The court system has not made it easy for us. And we've even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many. We've taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judge's, in my opinion, incorrect and unsafe ruling, our administration is working night and day to keep you safe -- including reporters safe -- and is vigorously defending this lawful order. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. And I keep my campaign promises. And our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are. I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places. In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I've heard 80 percent -- I find that hard to believe; that's just a number I heard -- that they're overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is, frankly, in turmoil. But we are appealing that and we are going further.  We're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we'll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that. At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people, and that will be done some time next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part. We've also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines -- thousands and thousands of jobs -- and put new ""Buy American"" measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen. We want them to use American steel. And they're willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn't say that. And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel? And they said, that's a good idea. We put it in. To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C. I've started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government. We've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It's a disaster. You can say, oh, Obamacare -- I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they're not the Republican people that our representatives are representing. So we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back. We're bringing our jobs back to this country big league. It's already happening, but big league. I've also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at Rex Tillerson -- he's out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people. Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens. Now, look, fair trade -- not free -- fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, we're not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us, almost. I may be able to find a couple that don't. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.  Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. Fiat-Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know -- you were here. General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here.  Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs. Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more. Many more. These are a few that we're naming. Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades -- decades and decades and decades, folks. And we're not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen. And one more thing. I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution -- highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats -- you may not see that, but he'll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes. This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it -- there has never been a presidency that's done so much in such a short period of time. And we haven't even started the big work that starts early next week. Some very big things are going to be announced next week.  So we're just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m. I hope to see you there. And with that, I'd just say, God bless America, and let's take some questions.  Mara. Mara, go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference. Q: Did you fire Mike Flynn? THE PRESIDENT: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who -- there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given.  He didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That's the real problem. And you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a fake news, fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this -- they know nothing about it. They weren't in Russia, they never made a phone call to Russia, they never received a phone call. It's all fake news. It's all fake news. The nice thing is I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal, Mara -- and I think it's very important -- the illegal giving out classified information. And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much. I'll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very confidential, classified call, but I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, that's -- I spoke to the President of Mexico, had a good call. All of a sudden it's out for the world to see. It's supposed to be secret. It's supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case. Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden people are finding out exactly what took place.  The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this, and I'm saying -- the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information that's classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because it's an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But, more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves. Really ashamed. Yes, go ahead. Q: Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost two weeks?  THE PRESIDENT: Because when I looked at the information, I said, I don't think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right. He was coming into office, he looked at the information. He said, huh, that's fine, that's what they're supposed to do. They're supposed to be -- and he didn't just call Russia. He called and spoke to, both ways -- I think there were 30-some-odd countries. He's doing the job. You know, he was just doing his job. The thing is he didn't tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he didn't remember. So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision. But he didn't tell the Vice President of the United States the facts, and then he didn't remember. And that just wasn't acceptable to me.  Yes. Q: President Trump, since you brought up Russia, I'm looking for some clarification here. During the campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations?  THE PRESIDENT: Well, the failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was -- it's a joke. And the people mentioned in the story -- I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren't even a part, really -- I mean, they were such a minor part -- I hadn't spoken to them. I think the one person, I don't think I've ever spoken to him. I don't think I've ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time. I don't think I ever met him. Now, it's possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don't think I ever met him. I didn't talk to him, ever. And he thought it was a joke. The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he'd represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia -- but knew that he represented various countries. That's what he does. I mean, people know that. That's Mr. Manafort, who's, by the way -- who's, by the way, a respected man. He's a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine, or Ukraine government, or somebody. But everybody -- people knew that. Everybody knew that. So these people -- and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories.  So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders -- almost all other leaders from almost all other countries. So that's the extent. Russia is fake news. Russia -- this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they're there -- because we have our new people going in place right now. As you know, Mike Pompeo is now taking control of the CIA. James Comey at FBI. Dan Coats is waiting to be approved. I mean, he is a senator, and a highly respected one. And he's still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.  And just while you're at, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New Times's story yesterday. And it talked about -- you saw it, front page. So, Director of National Intelligence just put out -- acting -- a statement: ""Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community"" -- this was just given to us -- ""is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true."" So they took this front-page story out of The Wall Street Journal -- top -- and they just wrote the story is not true. And I'll tell you something, I'll be honest -- because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but I've never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest. But I will say that I never get phone calls from the media. How do they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me? Or how do they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page? That was like that story they wrote about the women and me -- front page. Big massive story. And it was nasty.  And then they called. They said, ""We never said that. We like Mr. Trump."" They called up my office -- we like Mr. Trump; we never said that. And it was totally -- they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you -- totally misrepresented. I said, give us a retraction. They never gave us a retraction. And, frankly, I then went on to other things. Go ahead.  Q: Mr. President --  THE PRESIDENT: You okay? Q: I am. Just wanted to get untangled. Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes. In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008. THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm talking about Republican. Yes.  Q: President Obama, 332. George H.W. Bush, 426 when he won as President. So why should Americans trust --  THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, I was told -- I was given that information. I don't know. I was just given. We had a very, very big margin.  Q: I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when you're providing information that's fake? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don't know. I was given that information. I was given -- actually, I've seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory. Do you agree with that?  Q: You're the President.  THE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you. That's a good answer. Yes. Q: Mr. President, thank you so much. Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn -- there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you have the transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly Ambassador Kislyak, who he was communicating with? What evidence did you weigh to determine there was no wrong doing?  And further than that, sir, you've said on a couple of occasions this morning that you were going to aggressively pursue the sources of these leaks. THE PRESIDENT: We are. Q: Can we ask what you're doing to do? And also, we've heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by Stephen Feinberg. What can you tell us about that? THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they're in position. So I hope that we'll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else. The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man. And he has offered his services, and it's something we may take advantage of. But I don't think we'll need that at all because of the fact that I think that we're going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own. As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn't sound wrong. My counsel came -- Don McGahn, White House Counsel -- and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn't think anything is wrong. He really didn't think -- it was really what happened after that, but he didn't think anything was done wrong. I didn't either, because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it. I said, well, I don't see -- to me, he was doing the job.  The information was provided by -- who I don't know -- Sally Yates -- and I was a little surprised because I said, doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there. But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as the actual making the call -- in fact, I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job. That was very normal. At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So -- and I do -- and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.  Yes, Jon. Q: On the leaks, sir --  THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, finish off, then I'll get you, Jon. Q: Sorry, what will you do on the leaks? You have said twice today --  THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we're looking at it very, very seriously. I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and we're -- I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They're put out by people either in agencies. I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate. We just had Jeff Sessions approved in Justice, as an example. So we are looking into that very seriously. It's a criminal act.  You know what I say -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked. Because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment. When I was called out on Mexico, I was -- honestly, I was really, really surprised. But I said, you know, it doesn't make sense, that won't happen. But that wasn't that important to call, it was fine. I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world -- the President who is a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said, that's terrible that it was leaked but it wasn't that important. But then I said, what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea? What happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information -- very important, very -- I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too? So I don't want classified information getting out to the public. And in a way, that was almost a test. So I'm dealing with Mexico. I'm dealing with Argentina. We were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times. And I'm saying, what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East? What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea? We've got to stop it. That's why it's a criminal penalty. Yes, Jon. Q: Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to get you to clarify just a very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And, on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks? THE PRESIDENT: Well, the leaks are real. You're the one that wrote about them and reported them. I mean, the leaks are real. You know what they said -- you saw it. And the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.  So one thing that I felt it was very important to do -- and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for -- well, maybe a little bit -- than reporters, than good reporters. It's very important to me, and especially in this position. It's very important. I don't mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true. And over a course of time, I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and I'm okay with that. But I'm not okay when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN -- it's so much anger and hatred and just the hatred. I don't watch it anymore because it's very good -- he's saying no. It's okay, Jim. It's okay, Jim. You'll have your chance. But I watch others too. You're not the only one, so don't feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be -- I think it would be, frankly, more interesting. I know how good everybody's ratings are right now, but I think that actually would be -- I think that it would actually be better.  People -- I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that's right. I don't know, Peter, is that one right? Because you know, I think they have lower -- I heard, lower than Congress.  But honestly, the public would appreciate it. I'd appreciate it. Again, I don't mind bad stories when it's true. But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult. I think we're setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I'm looking -- some of them had them approved immediately. I'm going forever, and I still have a lot of people that we're waiting for. And that's all they're doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he's got over there, and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And you know, I think they'd be better served by approving and making sure that they're happy and everybody is good. And sometimes, I mean -- I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way. And that's okay. That's fine. But I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics. And they say it, and everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jim. Q: The first part of my question on contacts. Do you definitively say that nobody --  THE PRESIDENT: Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there. I have no anything. Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give -- they're not giving classified information. They're giving stuff -- what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates -- which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.  Can you imagine -- seriously, can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair, okay? ""He should be put in the electric chair."" You would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, okay? Maybe not you, Jon. Yes, we'll do you next, Jim. I'll do you next. Yes? Q: Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to clarify one other thing. THE PRESIDENT: Sure. Q: Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss the sanctions with the Russian ambassador? THE PRESIDENT: No, I didn't. No, I didn't.  Q: (Inaudible.) (Off mic.) THE PRESIDENT: No, I didn't.  Q: Did you fire him because (inaudible) --  THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me -- no, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence, very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn't doing it. I didn't direct him but I would have directed him because that's his job. And it came out that way -- and, in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job. And I agreed with him. And since then I've watched many other people say that. No, I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn't do it, okay?  Jim. Q: Mr. President, thank you very much. And just for the record, we don't hate you, I don't hate you. If you could pass that along.  THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Well, ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job, okay? Q: If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far, sir.  THE PRESIDENT: Well, not too many. We do have other people. You do have other people, and your ratings aren't as good as some of the other people that are waiting. Q: They're pretty good right now, actually. THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Go ahead, Jim. Q: If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that at one point. THE PRESIDENT: I was okay with it. Q: You said you loved WikiLeaks. At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 emails. I'm wondering, sir, if you -- THE PRESIDENT: Well, she was actually missing 33,000, and then that got extended with a whole pile after that, but that's okay. Q: Maybe my numbers are off a little bit too. THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but I did say 30,000, but it was actually higher than that. Q: If I may ask you, sir, it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged in the campaign. THE PRESIDENT: Okay, fair question. Ready? Q: So if I may ask you that -- if I may ask a follow-up -- THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but are you -- let me do one at a time. Do you mind? Q: Yes, sir. THE PRESIDENT: All right. So in one case you're talking about highly classified information. In the other case you're talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. I will say this: If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun. He said terrible things about her. But it wasn't classified information.  But in one case you're talking about classified. Regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong -- at my suggestion -- and I give Reince great credit for this -- at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism. I don't want to be hacked. And we did that, and you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed. The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked, and terrible things came. And the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so -- they were -- when I heard some of those things, I said -- I picked up the papers the next morning, I said, oh, this is going to front page. It wasn't even in the papers. Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been the headline in every newspaper.  I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions for the debate, and she should have reported herself. Why didn't Hillary Clinton announce that, ""I'm sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it's inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job""? Q: And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about -- you said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don't understand. It seems that there is a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake? THE PRESIDENT: Well, the reporting is fake. Look, look --  Q: And if I may ask -- I just want to ask one other question.  THE PRESIDENT: Jim, you know what it is? Here's the thing. The public isn't -- they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don't know if it's true or false because they're not involved. I'm involved. I've been involved with this stuff all my life. But I'm involved. So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not.  I just see many, many untruthful things. And I tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word ""tone."" The tone is such hatred. I'm really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such -- I do get good ratings, you have to admit that. The tone is such hatred.  I watched this morning a couple of the networks, and I have to say ""Fox & Friends"" in the morning, they're very honorable people. They're very -- not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That's all I can say. It's the most honest. But the tone, Jim. If you look -- the hatred. I mean, sometimes -- sometimes somebody gets --  Q: (Off mic.) THE PRESIDENT: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o'clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump. The good news is he doesn't have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump. And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth, the hatred coming from other people on your network. Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I'm amazed by it. And I just think you'd be a lot better off -- I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN.  I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it's brutal.  Now, they'll take this news conference. I'm actually having a very good time, okay? But they'll take this news conference -- don't forget that's the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day.  Q: (Off mic.) THE PRESIDENT: No, that's how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people, that's for sure.  But I am having a good time. Tomorrow they will say, Donald Trump rants and raves at the press. I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you, you're dishonest people. But -- but I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it. But tomorrow the headlines are going to be: Donald Trump Rants and Raves. I'm not ranting and raving.  Q: If I may just --  THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead. Q: One more follow-up because --  THE PRESIDENT: Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter?  Q: Just because of this --  THE PRESIDENT: Peter, should I have let him have a little bit more? Sit down. Sit down.  Q: Just because of the attack --  THE PRESIDENT: We'll get it.  Q: Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir --  THE PRESIDENT: I'm changing it from fake news, though. Q: Doesn't that undermine --  THE PRESIDENT: Very fake news now. (Laughter.)  Q: But aren't you --  THE PRESIDENT: Yes, go ahead.  Q: Real news, Mr. President. Real news.  THE PRESIDENT: And you're not related to our new --  Q: I am not related, sir, no. (Laughter.) I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say. THE PRESIDENT: I looked -- you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta.  Q: I'm sure you checked that out, sir. THE PRESIDENT: No, I checked it. I said -- they said, no, sir. I said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.  Q: But aren't you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment freedom of the press, the press in this country when you call stories you don't like ""fake news""? Why not just say it's a story I don't like?  THE PRESIDENT: I do that. Q: When you call it fake news, you're undermining confidence --  THE PRESIDENT: No, I do that. No, no, I do that. Q: -- in our news media. THE PRESIDENT: Here's the thing.  Q: Isn't that important? THE PRESIDENT: Okay, I understand -- and you're right about that except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I'll say, wow, that's going to be a great story, and I'll get killed. I know what's good and bad. I'd be a pretty good reporter -- not as good as you. But I know what's good. I know what's bad.  And when they change it and make it really bad -- something that should be positive. Sometimes something that should be very positive, they'll make okay. They'll even make it negative. So I understand it because I'm there. I know what was said. I know who is saying it. I'm there. So it's very important to me.  Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press. The press -- the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that, I don't know. But they don't believe you.  If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right? Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster, I would be your biggest fan in the world -- including bad stories about me. But if you go -- as an example, you're CNN -- I mean, it's story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing: Chaos. There's zero chaos. We are running -- this is a fine-tuned machine. And Reince happens to be doing a good job. But half of his job is putting out lies by the press.  I said to him yesterday, this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject, which is illegal leaks. But I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I'm saying, here's my Chief of Staff, a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, we won the election, right? We won the presidency. We got some senators. We got some -- all over the country, you take a look, he's done a great job.  And I said to myself, you know -- and I said to somebody that was in the room -- I said, you take a look at Reince, he's working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires. They're fake. They're not true. And isn't that a shame, because he'd rather be working on health care. He'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim. I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there's a certain bias, maybe by Jeff or somebody -- for whatever reason. And I understand that. But you've got to be at least a little bit fair. And that's why the public sees it -- they see it. They see it's not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred. And the public is smart. They understand it.  Okay, yeah, go ahead.  Q: We have no doubt that your latest story is (inaudible). But for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over these last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn't fake news? And secondly --  THE PRESIDENT: I think they don't believe it. I don't think the public would. That's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don't think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing -- that's a ruse. That's a ruse. And, by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that. Now, tomorrow you'll say, Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible. It's not terrible -- it's good. We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? It's this thing called nuclear weapons and other things. Like, lots of things are done with uranium, including some bad things. Nobody talks about that. I didn't do anything for Russia. I've done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks? Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button? Hillary Clinton -- that was a reset. Remember? It said ""reset.""  Now, if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who is going to be meeting with them shortly. And I told him, I said, I know politically it's probably not good for me. Hey, the greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles offshore right out of the water. Everyone in this country is going to say, oh, it's so great. That's not great. That's not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you've had a lot of Presidents that haven't taken that tact. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can -- now, I love to negotiate things. I do it really well and all that stuff, but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin. Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people -- the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said, you know -- he's sitting behind his desk and he's saying, you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely; it's got to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story. Okay? And that's a shame. Because if we could get along with Russia -- and, by the way, China and Japan and everyone -- if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing. Q: Tax reform -- Q: Mr. President, since you --  THE PRESIDENT: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We're doing Obamacare -- we're in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It's not like -- frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner. So we'll be submitting health care sometime in early March, mid-March. And after that, we're going to come up -- and we're doing very well on tax reform. Yes. Q: Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as President of the United States. THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Q: You mentioned the vessel, the spy vessel, off the coast of the United States. THE PRESIDENT: Not good. Q: There was a ballistic missile test that many interpreted as a violation --  THE PRESIDENT: Not good. Q: -- of the agreement between the two countries. And a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.  THE PRESIDENT: Not good. Q: I listened to you during the campaign --  THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me, excuse me, when did it happen? It happened when -- if you were Putin right now, you would say, hey, we're back to the old games with the United States. There's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us because the -- you have to understand, if I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, oh, isn't that wonderful. But I know you well enough. Then you would say, oh, he was too tough, he shouldn't have done that. Look, of all --  Q: I'm just trying to find out your orientation to those --  THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second.  Q: I'm just trying to find out what you're doing to do about them, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries to reset, it failed. They all tried. But I'm different than those people. Go ahead. Q: How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them? THE PRESIDENT: Just the way I said it. Q: Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal? THE PRESIDENT: I have. I have. And I'm so beautifully represented. I'm so honored that the Senate approved him. He's going to be fantastic. Yes, I think that I've already --  Q: Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir? THE PRESIDENT: No, I don't think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now. Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal. Now, I don't know that we're going to make a deal. I don't know. We might, we might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough -- the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what, I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world. If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along -- and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There's no upside. We're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I've been briefed. And I can tell you, one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it: Nuclear holocaust would be like no other. They're a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. Q: So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are --  THE PRESIDENT: Who did I say is not good? Q: No, when I read off the three things that have recently happened and each one of them you said they're not good. THE PRESIDENT: No, it's not good, but they happened. Q: But do they damage the relationship? Do they undermine this country's ability to work with Russia? THE PRESIDENT: They all happened recently, and I understand what they're doing, because they're doing the same thing. Now, again, maybe I'm not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don't, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Okay. But I tell you one thing: She tried to make a deal. She had the reset. She gave all the valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I'm close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She's close to Russia. I gave -- you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing. Q: Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations? THE PRESIDENT: I'm not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don't talk about military response. I don't say I'm going into Mosul in four months. ""We are going to attack Mosul in four months."" Then three months later: ""We are going to attack Mosul in one month."" ""Next week, we are going to attack Mosul."" In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I don't talk about military, and I don't talk about certain other things. You're going to be surprised to hear that. And, by the way, my whole campaign, I'd say that. So I don't have to tell you -- Q: There will be a response? THE PRESIDENT: I don't want to be one of these guys that say, ""Yes, here's what we're going to do."" I don't have to do that. Q: There will be a -- in other words, there will be a response, Mr. President?  THE PRESIDENT: I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea. Wait a minute. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea. And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn't know. And eventually you guys are going to get tired of asking that question. So when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship -- the Russian ship, as an example -- I'm not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won't have to do anything. But I'm not going to tell you. Okay. Q: Thanks. Q: Can I just ask you -- thank you very much, Mr. President -- the Trump -- THE PRESIDENT: Where are you from? Q: BBC. THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Here's another beauty. Q: That's a good line. Impartial, free, and fair. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, sure. Q: Mr. President -- THE PRESIDENT: Just like CNN, right? Q: Mr. President, on the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban, would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government, that fine-tuned --  THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I do. I do. And let me tell you about the travel --  Q: Were there any mistakes in that? THE PRESIDENT: Wait, wait, wait. I know who you are. Just wait. Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban, but we had a bad court. We got a bad decision. We had a court that's been overturned -- again, maybe wrong, but I think it's 80 percent of the time. A lot. We had a bad decision. We're going to keep going with that decision. We're going to put in a new executive order next week sometime. But we had a bad decision. That's the only thing that was wrong with the travel ban.  You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice buses, and they were put out at various locations. Despite that, the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect. Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order but said one thing -- and I said this to my people: Give them a one-month period of time. But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month -- the bad ones. You do agree, there are bad people out there, right? They're not everybody that's like you. You have some bad people out there.  So Kelly said, you can't do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it, I said, wow, never thought of it. I said, how about one week? He said, no good. You got to do it immediately, because if you do it immediately, they don't have time to come in. Now, nobody ever reports that, but that's why we did it quickly. Now, if would have done it a month, everything would have been perfect. The problems is we would have wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives, because a lot of bad people would have come into our country. Now, in the meantime, we've vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help, and we need help by getting that executive order passed. Q: Just a brief follow-up. And if it's so urgent, why not introduce -- THE PRESIDENT: Yes, go ahead. Q: Thank you. I just was hoping that we could get a yes- or-no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing. So that's one person. But he was dealing -- as he should have been -- Q: During the election? THE PRESIDENT: No, no, nobody that I know of. Q: So you're not aware of any contacts during the course of the election? THE PRESIDENT: Look, look, how many times do I have to answer this question?  Q: Can you just say yes or no on it? THE PRESIDENT: Russia is a ruse. Yeah, I know you have to get up and ask a question, so important. Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia, haven't made a phone call to Russia in years. Don't speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn't, I just have nobody to speak to. I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election -- I told you this -- and he called me on the inauguration, and a few days ago. We had a very good talk, especially the second one -- lasted for a pretty long period of time. I'm sure you probably get it because it was classified, so I'm sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk. I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.  Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now, people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that -- whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that. Q: But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election? THE PRESIDENT: I have -- you know what, he said no. I can only tell you what he -- now, he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right? He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, who's a good man also, by the way -- Paul Manafort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time. How much longer should we stay here, folks? Five more minutes, is that okay? Five?  Q: Mr. President, on national security -- THE PRESIDENT: Wait, let's see, who's -- I want to find a friendly reporter. Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait, wait -- watch how friendly he is. Go ahead. Go ahead. Q: So, first of all, my name is (inaudible) from (inaudible) Magazine. And (inaudible). I haven't seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or any of the -- anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic. We have an understanding of (inaudible). THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Q: However, what we are concerned about, and what we haven't really heard be addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it. There have been reports out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks. There are people who are committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to -- THE PRESIDENT: You see, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question. And it's not. It's not. Not a simple question, not a fair question. Okay, sit down. I understand the rest of your question.  So here's the story, folks. Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism -- the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican.  Q: (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT: Quiet, quiet, quiet. See, he lied about -- he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question. So you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something -- that I hate the charge. I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me -- and you heard the Prime Minister, you heard Netanyahu yesterday -- did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I've known Donald Trump for a long time, and then he said, forget it. So you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. Q: Thank you. I'm Lisa from the PBS -- THE PRESIDENT: See, it just shows you about the press, but that's the way the press is.  Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Lisa Desjardins from the PBS Newshour. THE PRESIDENT: Good. Q: On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you planned for next week, even its broad outlines? Will it be focused on specific countries? THE PRESIDENT: It's a very fair question. Q: And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration, what is your plan? Do you plan to continue that program or to end it? THE PRESIDENT: We're going to show great heart. DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it's one of the most difficult subjects I have, because you have these incredible kids, in many cases -- not in all cases. In some of the cases they're having DACA and they're gang members and they're drug dealers too. But you have some absolutely incredible kids -- I would say mostly -- they were brought here in such a way -- it's a very, very tough subject. We are going to deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget, and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that. But the DACA situation is a very, very -- it's a very difficult thing for me. Because, you know, I love these kids. I love kids. I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do. And you know, the law is rough. I'm not talking about new laws. I'm talking the existing law is very rough. It's very, very rough.  As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision, but we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways more. But we're tailoring it now to the decision. We have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it. And the new executive order is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. Okay? Q: Mr. President, Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House Visitors Office.  THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Q: And she does a lot of great work for the country as well. Can you tell us a little bit about what First Lady Melania Trump does for the country? And there is a unique level of interest in your administration, so by opening the White House Visitors Office, what does that mean to you? THE PRESIDENT: Now, that's what I call a nice question. That is very nice. Who are you with? Q: (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT: Good. I'm going to start watching. Thank you very much. Melania is terrific. She was here last night. We had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife, who is, by the way, lovely. And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election as you know, the Cuban people, Americans. And I think that Melania is going to be outstanding. That's right, she just opened up the Visitors Center -- in other words, touring of the White House.  She, like others that she's working with, feels very, very strongly about women's issues, women's difficulties, very, very strongly. And she's a very, very strong advocate. I think she's a great representative for this country. And a funny thing happens because she gets so unfairly maligned. The things they say -- I've known her for a long time. She was a very successful person. She was a very successful model. She did really well. She would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find. And the things they say -- and I've known her for a long time -- the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies. I'd just tell you this: I think she's going to be a fantastic First Lady. She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working with her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they're not doing this for money. They're not doing this for pay. They're doing this because they feel it, both of them. And Melania goes back and forth, and after Barron finishes school -- because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left -- she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. Thank you. That's a very nice question. Go ahead. Q: Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Oh, this is going to be a bad question but that's okay. Q: No, it's not going to be a bad question. THE PRESIDENT: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Q: Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you -- you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign.  THE PRESIDENT: Fix the inner cities, yes. Q: Fixing the inner cities. What will be that fix and your urban agenda, as well as your HBCU executive order that's coming out this afternoon? See, it wasn't bad, was it? THE PRESIDENT: That was very professional and very good. Q: I'm very professional. THE PRESIDENT: We'll be announcing the order in a little while, and I'd rather let the order speak for itself. But it will be something I think that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement. As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign. I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did much higher than people thought I was going to get and I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher. And, by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities having to do with education, having to do with crime. We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible -- you know it takes a long time. It's taken 100 years or more for some of these places to evolve, and they evolved many of them very badly. But we're going to be working very hard on health and health care; very, very hard on education. And also, we're going to working in a stringent way, and a very good way, on crime. You go to some of these inner city places, and it's so sad when you look at the crime. You have people -- and I've seen this, and I've sort of witnessed it. In fact, in two cases, I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day. They're living in hell. We can't let that happen. So we're going to be very, very strong. It's a great question, and it's a very difficult situation, because it's been many, many years. It's been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix. We have to help African American people that, for the most part are stuck there -- Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities, and they're living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know. There's one Chicago that's incredible, luxurious and all, and safe. There's another Chicago that's worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about, and that you talk about every night on the newscasts. So we're going to do a lot of work on the inner cities. I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. Q: Well, when you say -- when you say the inner cities, are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as your -- THE PRESIDENT: Am I going include who? Q: Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as well as --  THE PRESIDENT: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting? Do you want to set up the meeting? Q: No, no, no.  THE PRESIDENT: Are they friends of yours? Q: I'm just a reporter.  THE PRESIDENT: No, go ahead, set up the meeting. Q: I know some of them, but I'm sure they're watching right now. THE PRESIDENT: Let's go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it's great -- the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it's great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings, and he was all excited, and then he said, oh, I can't move, it might be bad for me politically, I can't have that meeting. I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him, and he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone. Very nice guy. Q: I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well. THE PRESIDENT: He wanted it. But we called, called, called, called -- they can't make a meeting with him. Every day, I walked in, I said, I would like to meet with him. Because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that -- some other lightweight -- he was probably told -- he was probably told, don't meet with Trump, it's bad politics. And that's part of the problem of this country. Okay, one more. Go ahead. Q: Yes, Mr. President, two questions -- THE PRESIDENT: No, no. One question. Two, we can't handle. This room can't handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two. Q: (Inaudible) it's not about your personality or your beliefs. We're talking about (inaudible) around the country, some of it by supporters in your name. What do you -- THE PRESIDENT: And some of it -- and can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don't think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you'll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they're put up by the other side, and you think it's like playing it straight. No. But you have some of those signs, and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They'll do signs and they'll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won't be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. Okay. Go ahead. Q: You are the President now. What are you going to do about it? THE PRESIDENT: Who is that? Where is that? Oh, stand up. You can -- Q: What are you going to do about the tensions that have been discussed? THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I'm working on it. No, I'm working on it very hard.  Q: Are you going to give a speech? THE PRESIDENT: No, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years, and long before that, in all fairness to President Obama. Long before President Obama, we have had a very divided. I didn't come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here.  We're going to work on it very hard. One of the questions that was asked -- I thought it was a very good question -- was about the inner cities. I mean, that's part of it. But we're going to work on education. We're going to work on lack -- you know, we're going to stop -- we're going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials. We're going to try and stop crime. We're not going to try and stop, we're going to stop crime.  But it's very important to me. But this isn't Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama, and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try -- I will do everything within my power to fix that.  I want to thank everybody very much. It's a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause.)"
