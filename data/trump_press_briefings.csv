Sean Spicer: Remarks to the Press by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-01-21,"5:39 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Good evening. Thank you guys for coming. I know our first official press briefing is going to be on Monday, but I wanted to give you a few updates on the President's activities. But before I get to the news of the day, I think I'd like to discuss a little bit of the coverage of the last 24 hours.  Yesterday, at a time when our nation and the world was watching the peaceful transition of power and, as the President said, the transition and the balance of power from Washington to the citizens of the United States, some members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting. For all the talk about the proper use of Twitter, two instances yesterday stand out.  One was a particular egregious example in which a reporter falsely tweeted out that the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. After it was pointed out that this was just plain wrong, the reporter casually reported and tweeted out and tried to claim that a Secret Service agent must have just been standing in front of it. This was irresponsible and reckless.  Secondly, photographs of the inaugural proceedings were intentionally framed in a way, in one particular tweet, to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall. This was the first time in our nation's history that floor coverings have been used to protect the grass on the Mall. That had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing, while in years past the grass eliminated this visual. This was also the first time that fencing and magnetometers went as far back on the Mall, preventing hundreds of thousands of people from being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had in inaugurations past. Inaccurate numbers involving crowd size were also tweeted. No one had numbers, because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall, does not put any out. By the way, this applies to any attempts to try to count the number of protestors today in the same fashion. We do know a few things, so let's go through the facts. We know that from the platform where the President was sworn in, to 4th Street, it holds about 250,000 people. From 4th Street to the media tent is about another 220,000. And from the media tent to the Washington Monument, another 250,000 people. All of this space was full when the President took the Oath of Office. We know that 420,000 people used the D.C. Metro public transit yesterday, which actually compares to 317,000 that used it for President Obama's last inaugural. This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration -- period -- both in person and around the globe. Even the New York Times printed a photograph showing a misrepresentation of the crowd in the original Tweet in their paper, which showed the full extent of the support, depth in crowd, and intensity that existed. These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong. The President was also at the -- as you know, the President was also at the Central Intelligence Agency and greeted by a raucous overflow crowd of some 400-plus CIA employees. There were over 1,000 requests to attend, prompting the President to note that he'll have to come back to greet the rest. The employees were ecstatic that he's the new Commander-in-Chief, and he delivered them a powerful and important message. He told them he has their back, and they were grateful for that. They gave him a five-minute standing ovation at the end in a display of their patriotism and their enthusiasm for his presidency.  I'd also note that it's a shame that the CIA didn't have a CIA Director to be with him today when he visited, because the Democrats have chosen -- Senate Democrats are stalling the nomination of Mike Pompeo and playing politics with national security. That's what you guys should be writing and covering, instead of sowing division about tweets and false narratives. The President is committed to unifying our country, and that was the focus of his inaugural address. This kind of dishonesty in the media, the challenging -- that bringing about our nation together is making it more difficult. There's been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable. And I'm here to tell you that it goes two ways. We're going to hold the press accountable, as well. The American people deserve better. And as long as he serves as the messenger for this incredible movement, he will take his message directly to the American people where his focus will always be. And with that, a few other updates from the day. The President had a constructive conversation with Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada about strengthening the relationship between our two nations. They also discussed setting up additional meetings in the days to come, which we will follow up on. He also spoke to Prime Minister Pe√±a Nieto of Mexico, and talked about a visit on trade, immigration and security that will occur on the 31st. The President will welcome his first foreign leader this Thursday when the United Kingdom's Theresa May will come to Washington -- on Friday.  Tomorrow, the President will oversee his Assistants to the President being sworn in. The staff will then have an ethics briefing, a briefing on the proper use and handling of classified information. Further updates as far as what he will do -- oh, and then in the evening, he will have a reception for law enforcement and first responders that helped support the inauguration.  Thank you guys for being here tonight. I will see you on Monday. END 5:44 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-01-31,"1:09 P.M. EST Good afternoon. I know you're all looking forward to what promises to be a historic night for the nation and for this President. The President is very excited to make his announcement of the next Associate Justice to the Supreme Court later this evening. According to some polls -- and you know we love polls around here -- for 70 percent of the voters, the President's choice for Supreme Court was an important factor in their choice at the ballot box in November. For more than one in five, it was the most important factor. Tonight, he will formally present his nominee to the American people, and I can assure you that this individual will make those voters and every American very, very proud. This particular choice is one that the President takes very seriously. He knows it will impact the course of our country's jurisprudence for generations to come. As such, he's taken careful steps to ensure that this process has both been transparent and inclusive. He has been speaking about the list of individuals that he may nominate since May of this year, and, after consulting with several influential groups, released a definitive list of 21 in September, pledging that his nominee will solely come from that list. He sought the advice and consent of both Republicans and Democrats, senators throughout this process. The President recognizes the gravity of his choice to fill the seat left by Justice Scalia, one of the most steadfast protectors of our liberty and devotees of our Constitution that ever graced the bench. Whomever the President selects will be a worthy successor to the brilliant legal mind and constitutional dedication of Justice Scalia. It's our intention to start promptly tonight in the East Room at 8:02 p.m. Pre-set will begin at 6:30. The East Room will be available for live shots approximately 20 minutes following the announcement, and both the Briefing Room and Pebble Beach outside have extended hours tonight to accommodate any additional journalistic needs. We'll have further guidance on tonight's plans as the day evolves. Moving to the news of the day, I know that Secretary Kelly, alongside other DHS officials, just recently concluded a briefing on the operational implementation of the President's executive order. I think it's pretty clear from the Secretary's press conference that this executive order was enacted with the proper preparation and coordination between the White House and DHS, and that implementation will continue and proceed as planned. We also have a few updates on the leadership of some of our most critical government agencies. Last night, as you know, the President relieved Sally Yates of her duties as acting Attorney General and named Dana Boente, as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as the acting Attorney General until Democratic senators finally quit their obstruction and confirm the unquestionably qualified Senator Jeff Sessions as our next Attorney General. Ms. Yates failed to enforce a legal order, approved by the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel and designed to protect the citizens of the United States. Calling for tougher vetting for individuals traveling from seven nations is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country. Around 9:00 p.m. last night, the President signed an affidavit of nomination for Mr. Boente. As one of his first official actions in his new post as acting Attorney General, he signed a memorandum rescinding Sally Yates' guidance regarding the President's executive order to ensure its full implementation. Last night, the President also announced the appointment of Thomas Homan as Acting Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security and Director of ICE. Mr. Homan has had a long career at ICE, most recently serving as the Executive Associate Director for Enforcement and Removal Operations. Having a professional in place like this go serve as the acting director is critical to ensuring the efficient administration of the President's agenda. One other update on a story from yesterday. I hope you all saw the statement that was put out from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where Chairman Dunford noted -- discussed the reorganization of the National Security Council. And he made it clear that he continues to fully participate in the interagency process and provide the best possible military advice to the President and members of the NSC. I really hope that that statement closes the book on the misleading narrative, and this should hopefully be the final time that we have to address what was in the national security directive. The family of the President -- excuse me, the President also had a very somber and lengthy conversation with the family of [Navy] Chief Petty Officer William ""Ryan"" Owens. The President offered his sincerest condolences to Officer Owens's wife, his father, and their three children. Chief Owens was on his 12th deployment, from what I understand. We could never repay the debt of gratitude we owe him, the freedom that he fought for, and the sacrifice that he made, as well as the other members of his unit who were injured in this operation. Today in the Senate, two of the President's nominees advanced out of the committee. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved the nominations of both Congressman Ryan Zinke as the next Interior Secretary and the nomination of former Texas Governor Rick Perry as the next Secretary of Energy. Elaine Chao also gratefully received the approval of the full Senate to become the next Secretary of Transportation. I expect further guidance on her official swearing-in to come very soon. The Senate Democrats have done everything in their power to slow the work of the Senate, while the President continues to take decisive action, just like he promised. So it's unfortunate that Senate Democrats remain so out of touch with the message that the American people sent this past November -- that people want change. President Trump is delivering that change, and the only response from Senate Democrats so far is to try to stall the core functions of our government. I know that I've repeated this every day, but honestly it's getting a bit ridiculous. The idea that these highly qualified nominees have the votes for their nominations to be endorsed out of committee and get a full vote are being stalled because Democrats are boycotting the committee vote is outrageous. The mere idea that they're not even showing up to hearings is truly outrageous. So I'd like to give a special shout-out to the folks at C-SPAN for making sure that all of these embarrassing actions by Senate Democrats get the wall-to-wall coverage that they deserve. Voters are going to remember what senators stood in the way of when President Trump -- by President Trump trying to install his agency and department leaders the next time their name is on a ballot. I don't mean to sound like a broken record, but the numbers don't lie. Sixteen of President Trump's nominees to head major department or agencies are still waiting to be confirmed. At the same time in 2009, President Obama only had seven of these people awaiting confirmation. In 2001, President Bush had all but two. Moving on, here at the White House, this morning, we reiterated the President's intention to continue to enforce the executive order protecting employees from the anti-LGBTQ discrimination while working for the federal government or contractors. Also this morning, the President had a breakfast and listening session with major pharmaceutical company executives in the Roosevelt Room: Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Celgene, Amgen, Eli Lilly, and the PhRMA trade group were represented at the meeting. Chairman Greg Walden, Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, also participated. During the meeting, the President commended their progress in lowering drugs prices but also reiterated his insistence that there is more work to be done. He promised to continue reducing the burdensome regulations that raise the cost of doing business in America. He was pleased to hear that the Chairman of Amgen, Robert Bradway, discussed how 1,600 American jobs will be added by Amgen. This administration will continue to prioritize jobs and make it easier for businesses around this country to hire more Americans.  The President had lunch with Mayor Giuliani just a short time ago, who serves as the CEO of an international security firm, Giuliani Partners, and was tapped by the President to lend his expertise to the administration's cyber efforts. Mayor Giuliani was asked to initiate this process because of his long and very successful government career in law enforcement and his 15 years private sector security, providing solutions for the challenges that we face in the cyber world. During the transition, the President announced that he intended to host a series of meetings with senior corporate executives from companies that are facing challenges, such as hacking, intrusions, disruptions, manipulations, theft of data and identities, and securing information from technological infrastructures. These are the same challenges facing the government that are facing public entities and businesses, and the President believes that solutions to these issues will often come from the private sector. Following the lunch with Mayor Giuliani, the President will host a listening session with these cybersecurity experts and Mayor Giuliani. No consensus or advice on the recommendations resulting from the group are wildly expected, but we do expect a spirited and wide-ranging discussion regarding the growing cybersecurity threats that our nation is facing. Later this afternoon, the President will sign an executive order -- or potentially sign one -- the federal government cybersecurity efforts, and give leaders the tools they need to keep the country safe from cyberattacks. The order does three main things: It secures the federal networks we operate on behalf of the American people. It will work with industry to protect critical infrastructure and maintain our way of life. And it will advance the cause of Internet freedom. More information will be available later this afternoon, but the executive order is the first step in the President taking to address the new security challenges of the 21st century. The Vice President today participated in the Republican Policy lunch today in the Senate. He'll hold several meetings with members on Capitol Hill, the beginning of extensive outreach by our Legislative Affairs team on the President's Supreme Court choice. Tonight, the Vice President will swear in Elaine Chao, as I mentioned. We'll have further updates. We expect it to be at 5 o'clock in the ceremonial office across the way, in the Old Executive Office Building. Secretary Chao is one of the most successful Cabinet officials in American history, having been the longest tenured Secretary of Labor since WWII, and also serving as the Deputy Secretary of Transportation under George H.W. Bush's administration. She's the perfect choice to lead the Department of Transportation into what promises to be a significant period of modernization and improvement. As I already mentioned, the last thing on our schedule for tonight is the President's announcement of the next Associate Justice for the Supreme Court.  Tomorrow is the kick-off for Black History Month, and the White House is excited to host a series of events this month in recognition of it. In particular, the U.S. Post Office will hold a ceremony tomorrow celebrating the official issuance of the Dorothy Height Forever stamp. Dr. Height led the National Council of Negro Women for four decades and is a true pioneer in the Civil Rights Movement. Finally, a couple administrative notes. On Friday, the President will depart from this White House to the ""Winter White House"" down at Mar-A-Lago, where he'll spend the weekend and be holding meetings. Further guidance on both trips will be coming out throughout the week. And I'm excited to announce that following up on our announcement of expanding the press briefing room to Skype seats, we'll officially be launching the briefing room tomorrow. The inaugural panelists will be Natalie Herbick, from Fox 8 in Cleveland, Ohio; Lars Larson of the Lars Larson Show; Jeff Jobe, from Jobe Publishing in South Central Kentucky; and Kimberly Kalunian, from WPRI in Rhode Island. Not sure how she snuck in there. (Laughter.)  I look forward to virtually welcoming them to the briefing room. And with that, some questions.  John Roberts. Q The removal last night of Ms. Yates from her position has raised questions as to how this President will deal with dissent in the ranks currently and in the future. Does he see what she said yesterday as a difference of opinion, an active insubordination? How would he read it? And how will he act on similar things in the future? MR. SPICER: Well, there's a big difference, John, between listening and sharing ideas, and executing lawful orders. It is the right of every American to express their idea and opinion, and, frankly, that's what you've seen the President do today. We're talking about leaving -- at 2 o'clock hour, him sitting down with cyber experts to get their opinions and ideas on how to protect our critical infrastructures. But there's a difference. When she, as the Acting Attorney General, is not only responsible but required to execute lawful orders and defiantly says ""no,"" as someone who was chosen to lead a department, she was rightfully removed. That is a position of leadership that is given to somebody who is supposed to execute orders that are handed down to them properly, of which that executive order was 100 percent done. Ironically, it went through their office's -- the Department of Justice Office of Legal Compliance. So the idea that it went through the entire process of which they were part of, and then she chooses not to execute it, actually is bewildering as well as defiant. Q So is the President -- so, sorry, can I just follow up on that? So is the President laying down a marker now to all of his Cabinet secretaries and all of his other officials to say, if I give you a directive and you do not follow it, you're gone? MR. SPICER: Well, I think that that kind of comes with the job, right? If you don't believe in the President's agenda -- and I think every one of the Cabinet members, every one of the appointees understands that they serve at the pleasure of the President. We talked about this at length during the transition. This isn't about joining the government to execute your ideas or your initiatives. The President was very clear during the campaign, whether it was economic security or national security, that he has an agenda that he articulated very, very clearly to the American people, and that -- Q But -- MR. SPICER: Hold on. Thank you. And that it is his job to lay that vision out, and that the people that he appoints and nominates and announces as staff members or Cabinet-level members or agency heads, their job is to fulfill that. And if they don't like it, then they shouldn't take the job. But it is the President's agenda that we are fulfilling here. Trey. Q Thanks, Sean. As it relates to the executive order today, how will the Trump administration ensure the digital privacy of all Americans as the President looks to strengthen U.S. cybersecurity? MR. SPICER: Well, look, just to be clear on the executive order, I think one of the things that the President -- the reason the President wants Mayor Giuliani and some of these cyber experts to come in is to get their ideas, to make sure that where we're headed in cybersecurity is fulfilling the intent that ensures that our critical infrastructures throughout the government and, frankly, throughout business -- to the extent that the government can be helpful in that -- are protected and secured. So I just want to caution what we may or may not do today. I think the President has got a pretty good idea of where he's going to go, but I think he wants to hear what Mayor Giuliani and some of these other experts have to say about the steps that we can take in terms of executive action that will help secure further these critical infrastructures. April. Q Sean, I have a couple of questions. I want to go back to the issue of this travel ban. MR. SPICER: Well, first of all, it's not a travel ban. I think you heard Secretary Kelly -- I apologize, I just want to make sure I get this straight. I think Secretary Kelly or one of the other individuals that got up there from DHS mentioned I think a million people have now come into this country. That's not a ban. What it is, is to make sure that the people who are coming in are vetted properly from seven countries that were identified by the Obama administration. A ban would mean people can't get in. We've clearly seen hundreds of thousands of people come into our country from other countries. Sorry. Go ahead. Q Okay. But mind you, I have two questions. (Laughter.)  MR. SPICER: I know, of course. Q So with all of this happening, and as you're trying to give specifics about what's happening, what is the concern about the fallout from other countries who are viewing this still in a certain way? Have you looked at the fallout and how to counter it, and how to work with these other countries that may be allies, or even may not be allies, in order to prevent something from happening? MR. SPICER: Well, I think, April, one of the things that we're doing is trying to make sure that people understand what actually happened. I saw reporting today that Secretary Kelly was out of the loop and he was on a plane and flying, and then it was reported on one of the networks and major institutions about what happened. And Secretary Kelly comes out and says, I was briefed on this time, I was talked on this time, the edits came from my staff. I don't know how -- I don't want to spend each of these briefings talking about misinformation, but at the end of the day, a major newspaper and a major network reported today that they were kept out of the loop. The Secretary detailed multiple occasions in which he was briefed on it. His staff made edits to it. I don't know how much more -- and so I think part of what we're trying to do is make sure that people actually understand what happened, what the process was, and what the order actually does. Because when we use words like ""travel ban,"" that misrepresents what it is. It's seven countries previously identified by the Obama administration where, frankly, we don't get the information that we need for people coming into this country. Because what this isn't about is not just the people. It's about the information that another country provides us. So we work with other countries, and we have systems in place to ensure that when you travel from our country to their -- or from their country to our country or vice versa, that we are sharing information about passengers and citizens that are going in and out.  These seven countries in particular, we don't have the information that is necessarily required to make an accurate determination at the time of entry into our country. So we are going to make sure that because that country doesn't have maybe either the systems in place or, in some cases, the willingness to provide us the information necessary to ensure that the people that are coming into this country are properly vetted. This isn't about refugees, it's about travelers. And that's what this is about. And so part of what we're doing is, frankly, making sure that other countries understand exactly what was in the order, how it, how it applies, what it means to visas and waivers and all this kind of stuff. But for the most part, you've seen a lot of panic, and the people actually stopping, reading the order, and realizing, ""oh, that's it?""  And I think that's what we've tried to make sure that people have the facts.  Q So you're doing outreach for that? MR. SPICER: We're doing -- we're not just doing outreach. I think we're doing as many briefings -- Secretary Kelly going out there a little while ago with the head of both ICE and CBP is trying to make sure that people understand that the process is working correctly -- it's working very well -- that the government is doing what it's supposed to, to protect its people. And that's the number one thing that we can do. Yeah. Q One other -- you said, two. MR. SPICER: I'm sorry. You're right. Q Now, the President met with the pharmaceutical heads. MR. SPICER: Yeah. Q When is this meeting scheduled for Congressman Elijah Cummings and President Trump, after that call that President Trump made -- MR. SPICER: Right. My understanding is that Congressman Cummings was -- he was invited to this meeting. He had a scheduling conflict, and we're looking at setting it back up. But he was invited to the meeting today. He informed us he had a scheduling conflict. And we're looking to get it back on the books as soon as we can. Q Would it be one on one? Not -- MR. SPICER: I expect at this point it will be one on one. Q Thanks, a lot, Sean. Does the President anticipate a difficult confirmation fight for his nominee, whoever that is? MR. SPICER: No. I think we've proven so far that the Democrats can try to obstruct, but at the end of the day, the will of the American people is going to overcome that. And again, what I mentioned at the outset of this is the advice and consent piece of this. He and our team have met with senators from both sides of the aisle to make sure that we understand the qualities that they are looking for in the next associate justice. And I think that we have done a very, very good job of getting a nominee in place that will be announced tonight that meets the criteria that they set forth. They may not like their political or philosophical background, but I think the criteria in terms of academia background, time on the bench, the expertise and criteria meets the intent of both Republicans and Democrats. John Gizzi. Q Do you believe you can get nine Democrats to support this nominee? MR. SPICER: I do. Absolutely. Because I think at the end of the day, one of the things that's been a time-honored tradition in this country is that we recognize that the confirmation process is -- the default is that if you're qualified for the position, then you should be confirmed. Not the other around. And I think that most Democrats realize that at some point that is -- having a court that is not fully operational is not the political fight to have. John Gizzi. Q Sean, let me ask you the obvious follow-up question then. At least one Republican senator has said Democrats have removed the filibuster from just about every other appointment, aside from the Supreme Court. And he said several Republicans say they would have no hesitation about moving for another nuclear option if Democrats attempt a filibuster of any of the possible nominees. Is this something the President would support? And has he discussed it with members of the Senate? MR. SPICER: Well, I think first and foremost taking a step to the last question, I think we're going to get the nine senators regardless, and I wouldn't be surprised if we get more. When you look -- and I'll be able to shed more light on this tomorrow in terms of the background. But I think that he is -- we've got an individual that I think is hopefully going to garner widespread bipartisan support because I think this individual has the qualifications and the experience and the judicial philosophy that should win bipartisan support.  That being said, beyond that, I would suggest that that's -- Senator McConnell has done a phenomenal job of moving things along in the Senate to the extent that Democrats will let him. And I'll leave any further questions on how the Senate operates to him. Blake. Q Sean, thanks. We know that the list of 21 was put out during the campaign. We know that, at 8:02 tonight, the President is going to reveal his selection. Can you kind of fill the gap in between as to how often the President might have spoken with this person, whether there were any meetings here at the White House, just any of the -- how he got there? And then the last hours -- (laughter) -- or in the last days here, really, who has he leaned on to kind of narrow this down? And then a follow-up, if you don't mind. MR. SPICER: I will say, I think I can probably shed a lot more light on this tomorrow. I appreciate the effort to try to head that off. Tomorrow I think we might be able to have a little bit more of a discussion as to how the President came to this choice. He may touch on it a little tonight; I'll leave it to him. But I appreciate that. Q Let me ask you about the news of the day. Prescription drug prices -- the President met with the pharma leaders earlier today. What makes him so confident that he can drive down drug prices, whereas administrations past have tried to do the same but haven't been able to? How is he going to go about it? MR. SPICER: Well, I think it's the story of his entire administration. He's a successful businessman and a top-notch negotiator. Several people tried to get the cost of planes down, the cost of the F-35 and the cost of the Air Force One. And through a couple of conversations, he did it -- shaved billions off of the cost of both -- excuse me, off the F-35 and significant off the next generation of Air Force One. I think he has a track record so far just during the transition, but also as a businessman -- he knows how to negotiate. And I think he is going to sit down with these individuals the same way that he's getting people to understand the agenda and the regulatory and tax climate that he wants to institute that's bringing jobs home. People are making a commitment to him to bring jobs and manufacturing back based on his track record as a businessman and his word. They understand that he's going to create a climate that supports the American worker and American manufacturing.  So I think -- you look over and over again, the number of companies that want to come back and say, we want to be part of this agenda to grow the economy and to create jobs or to help you fight on behalf of taxpayers, and I think you're going to continue to see that. He understands the challenges that the bureaucracy that's holding back some of the negotiating, that's allowing these prescription drug prices to drop or get the best deal for the government in cases whether it's Medicare or Medicaid, who are such large buyers of the VA -- that you're not -- you have got such purchasing power that's not being utilized to the full extent. Hunter Walker. Q Thank you, Sean. The President is meeting with Mayor Giuliani today. What do you think of the mayor's claim that the executive order on those seven countries evolved from the Muslim ban that the President proposed during the campaign? Is that accurate? MR. SPICER: I think the President has talked about extreme vetting and the need to keep America safe for a very, very long time. At the same time, he's also made very clear that this is not a Muslim ban. It's not a travel ban. It's a vetting system to keep America safe -- that's it, plain and simple. And all of the facts and a reading of it clearly show that that's what it is. Q Mayor Giuliani stressed that too, but he said that it came out of the desire to have a Muslim ban. MR. SPICER: Then you should ask Mayor Giuliani. That's his opinion. I'm just telling you what the President has said and what the President has done has been to focus on making sure that we keep the country safe and that the executive order that was drafted does just that -- is to make sure and to ensure that people coming in from seven countries, identified by the Obama administration, that we didn't have the proper systems to know who was coming into our country was put in place, and a 90-day period was also granted to ensure that we knew how to further address vetting situations in the future. Zeke. Q Thanks, Sean. Just following up again about the strike over the weekend in Yemen. Can you confirm that the eight-year-old -- the reports that the eight-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in that strike? And if you can address sort of the killing of the American citizen in this anti-terrorism operation. MR. SPICER: I'm not going to go any further than what the Department of Defense has released. Obviously, we recovered a tremendous amount of information, and we killed an estimated 14 members of al Qaeda in -- AQAP individuals. And then we suffered the loss of life of a servicemember, and four people were injured. That's as far as I'm willing to go at this time. Kristen. Q Sean, thanks. You're saying it's not a ban. This was President Trump's tweet yesterday: ""If the ban were announced with a one-week notice, the 'bad' would rush into our country during that week."" So he says it's a ban.  MR. SPICER: He's using the words that the media is using. But at the end of the day, it can't -- Q Those are his words. Q Wait a minute. MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on, hold on. It can't be -- Q That's his words, his tweet. MR. SPICER: Jonathan, thanks, I'll let Kristen talk. It can't be a ban if you're letting a million people in. If 325,000 people from another country can't come in, that is by nature not a ban -- it is extreme vetting. Q I understand your point. But the President himself called it a ban. MR. SPICER: I understand that. Q Is he confused or are you confused? MR. SPICER: No, I'm not confused. I think that the words that are being used to describe it are derived from what the media is calling this. He has been very clear that it is extreme vetting. Q It seems to fit into this broader point, Sean, which Paul Ryan said today: ""I think it's regrettable that there was some confusion on the rollout of this."" The House Speaker saying that. What do you say to Republicans who argue that this is a part of a broader issue with the President not enacting this policy smoothly? MR. SPICER: Well, first of all, I think we've addressed that -- that we could have either telegraphed this days in advance, in which people could have gotten on planes and come over here, which would have undermined the exact nature of what this sought to prevent. Or we could have done it in a way that inconvenienced some folks for a little while -- Q But do you dispute that there was confusion -- MR. SPICER: Can I answer the -- no, no, I do -- there's clearly some confusion. But I think part of it, your network was one of the people that just hours ago told people that General Kelly was unaware of what's going on. And then moments later he gets on air saying, here's how many times I got briefed. So, I mean, with all due respect, I think you have been part of the confusion. You have helped cause this, despite claims that whatever. You claim that you have sources that tell us. General Kelly stands up and says, this is how many times I've been briefed, this is how many people were involved. And yet you were out there for -- Q I think there was a New York Times report that was cited -- MR. SPICER: Oh, okay, so I apologize if NBC News's reporting is based on The New York Times's false reporting.  Q It was accurate reporting, Sean. MR. SPICER: How can it be accurate reporting, Glenn, if -- Q Both things can be true. Q It was accurate reporting, Sean. MR. SPICER: Okay, so the -- Q They can be true that he -- MR. SPICER: The Secretary of Homeland Security just stood up, and so you're calling him a liar? Q He didn't say he saw the specifics of the --  MR. SPICER: Jonathan, I'm talking to Glenn. I'm talking to Glenn. Q No one is calling anyone a liar. I'm saying we -- MR. SPICER: You said that the report in the New York Times said that he was unaware of the ban.  Q Sean, let me ask you a question.  MR. SPICER: Hold on. No, no, answer the question. Because you just called this -- Q So a couple of minutes ago you stood at the podium and you reiterated something you said yesterday about anyone who doesn't agree in terms of career bureaucracy should hit the road. I'm paraphrasing. You had a statement that President Trump made where he accused the acting Attorney General of ""betraying"" her own department by expressing a counter opinion. Don't you think that kind of language has a chilling effect on the public statements that your officials make? MR. SPICER: No, I think there's a big difference. Think about the process that worked it here. The Department of Justice's Office of Legal Compliance vetted the executive order, sent it back to us saying it was completely compliant. Then the acting Attorney General goes out and says, I'm not going to enforce it. You tell me how that jives. Because at the end of the day, if the action Attorney General has an office under her jurisdiction that says that something is legal and compliant, and then she gets out there and says, I'm not going to enforce it, that doesn't sound like an Attorney General that is upholding the duty that she swore to uphold. Q Well, if she think it's illegal -- MR. SPICER: At the end of the day -- then she should step down. But at the end of the day, the Attorney General either had a problem with her own division approving something. But it wasn't the President she had a problem with. The President followed the process, sought feedback, went through the inter-agency review, had other departments sign off, despite the reporting that said it was otherwise.  Q But is this a betrayal, though?  MR. SPICER: Hold on. Guys -- Q Is it a betrayal?  MR. SPICER: David. Q That's a very hard word.  MR. SPICER: Why don't we just let me answer Glenn so we can be polite now, huh?  And what the answer is, is that we went through the process. The Office of Legal Compliance came back and said, this is a compliant executive order, it's fully legal, and it can be executed. So then for the Attorney General to turn around and say, I'm not going to uphold this lawful executive order is clearly a dereliction of duty. And she should have been removed, and she was. I just -- it is odd to me that we're having a discussion about somebody whose job it is to execute lawful orders who chose not to do it -- hold on -- who chose not to do it, and then we're questioning whether or not we were right to remove her. That's the right thing to do. And if you looked at the folks from the right and the left, constitutional scholars this morning -- they said, we might not agree with some of the policies or the political -- or the party of the President, but he was right to do this. He had every right -- Q So why use the word ""betrayal"" -- MR. SPICER: Because the department's job is to execute. They're the Department of Justice. And if you have a legally executed order and the Attorney General says, I'm not going to execute it, that truly -- that clearly is a betrayal of what she's -- Q Let's define the word ""betrayal."" MR. SPICER: I'm not going to define the word, Glenn. Yes. Q Sean, I think the New York Times report said that the Secretary did not receive a full briefing until the executive order was being signed. So my question is, can we expect that secretaries, agency heads, when there are future executive orders or changes of policy, may not receive full briefings before -- MR. SPICER: Look, the Secretary was briefed on multiple occasions with the language of the order. I don't know how you can say this any other way. Q Well, I'm just talking about a full briefing, which is what the New York Times reported. MR. SPICER: And I'm telling you that I don't believe the New York Times reporting is accurate. What I'm telling you is that the Secretary on multiple occasions was briefed, his senior officials were briefed -- not just briefed; they were part of the drafting process. It went through -- not only that. Just back up. So they get consulted and briefed. It goes through the Office of Legal Compliance. Then it gets shipped out to the NSC and the Homeland Security Council. This went through a very, very extensive staffing process.  So the idea that you can talk whether or not he got fully briefed or -- he was briefed multiple times, saw the language. His staff made edits. It came back multiple times. I'm not sure how much more briefing you can do.  Q Thank you, Sean. Zoe Daniel, from Australian Broadcasting. Thanks for taking the question. The Australian government made a recent deal with the Obama administration whereby the U.S. would take refugees from Australia's offshore detention centers. Now most of these people are from Iran, but also some are from Iraq and Somalia, among other places. Can you confirm that this deal is still on? Are those refugees exempt from what you describe as the extreme vetting? Or will that deal change or be delayed? MR. SPICER: So the deal specifically deals with 1,250 people. They're mostly in Papua New Guinea, being held. Those people -- part of the deal is that they have to be vetted in the same manner that we're doing now. There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them. That is part and parcel of the deal that was made. And it was made by the Obama administration with the full backing of the United States government.  The President, in accordance with that deal to honor what had been agreed upon by the United States government, and in ensuring that that vetting will take place in the same manner that we're doing it now, will go forward. Yes. Q The big question -- looking at the bigger picture -- this President, when he came in, said he was going to gather us all together, that he was going to bring us together. And the actions taken in the first 10 days seem to indicate otherwise from people in his own party -- the use of the word ""betrayal."" How is this President going to address the fact that people are looking to him to bring people together, and yet with his own words seems to be driving us apart? MR. SPICER: I think that's a very one-sided way of looking at this. I think he's brought -- Q Elaborate. MR. SPICER: I will. I think he's brought unions together, business leaders together, Republicans, Democrats, independents. I think someone who doesn't carry out an act and using that as a way to describe that he's not bringing the country together is not exactly a representation.  Q I have one quick follow-up. MR. SPICER: Hold on. I don't -- I'm not -- the President has done a tremendous amount through both what he has said and done, more importantly, to start to bring this country together. And his policies, frankly, are focused on keeping every American safe and getting every American a higher-paying and better-paying job. I think that is something that benefits all of us. Q The follow-up -- I asked you about a shield law for journalists last week. You said you would get with this? Q If I could just -- MR. SPICER: Hold on. Q -- ask real quick on trade. Now that notices have been given to the TPP countries, are you considering any changes in the roles of your three sort of official trade negotiators? And what area of the globe are you going to start first on negotiations? MR. SPICER: Well, there's no change in their roles. I'm not entirely sure. I think they -- as announced -- Q (Inaudible) negotiator -- MR. SPICER: He is the U.S. -- I mean, he's got to be confirmed first, but the U.S. trade representative is clearly the leader of negotiating trade deals. Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro and Jason Greenblatt -- there's a great, unbelievably robust, brilliant team that has continued to work on behalf of deals and renegotiating, looking at them. So it's a two-step process. I think, number one, we're going to reexamine all of the current trade deals, figure out if we can re-improve them. But secondly, I think we're going to start talking to other countries around the globe, including some of those TPP partners. I think of the 11 other countries, five of them we have current trade deals with. So you would examine those to see if we can improve upon them and then look at the other countries in there and see if there's a willingness to engage with some of those other countries. Q Sean, the President has previously indicated that he would encourage the targeting of families of terror suspects. Is that still his current position? MR. SPICER: When did he say that? Q December 3rd, on Fox. He said, ""The other thing with [the] terrorists is you have to take out their families."" Is that still his position? MR. SPICER: I think he's been very clear that when it comes to seeking out ISIS and other terrorists, that he's going to lean on Director Pompeo, General Mattis, and seek their opinion on stuff. And I think that will be continued. Sarah. Q Even the families of terror suspects, civilian members of families, Sean? MR. SPICER: Thank you. Rebecca. Q On Guantanamo, Sean. Thanks for taking this question. I know that you've indicated at that podium that there will be further action. What does this look like? And there are five detainees that have been cleared for transfer that are sitting at Guantanamo. Would this administration take action in the next coming months on those detainees? MR. SPICER: I think all of those actions are being currently reviewed, and we don't have anything further at this time. Q The Obama administration's endangerment finding undergirds the Clean Power Plan. Does the President still plan to revoke the Clean Power Plan? And would he perhaps even go further and try and revoke the endangerment finding? MR. SPICER: Well, I think the President has made very clear with respect to energy policy that he wants to review all of the options that we have to use our natural resources to better the country in terms of wind power, solar, clean coal. We're in the process of reviewing all of our energy policies. I'd go back to note that we don't have an Energy Secretary confirmed right now because the Senate hasn't yet moved forward with that. I hope that once that's done, we will have further updates on energy. Matt. Q Sean, Sally Yates was obviously an Obama appointee, was holding it through the transition. How many more of them are there throughout the government at this time, as the transition and confirmation process plays out? And do you expect any more problems from any of the other ones? MR. SPICER: In some cases, we've held some individuals over because they hold a critical position within government. In some cases, we've named folks as acting. It's a case-by-case basis. And again, I think part of it right now is the President wanted to focus on getting his Cabinet up and complete. We'll continue to make nominations both at the deputy, under and assistant secretary-level.  But in key agencies -- so, ICE being one of them, where it's an assistant secretary. But there are 30 other agencies where we've named acting heads to ensure that as we move through the confirmation process, we have somebody in that position to ensure continuity of government.  Daniel. Q Sean, yesterday you said 109 individuals were affected by this extreme vetting. MR. SPICER: Right. Q DHS officials said that it was over 1,100. MR. SPICER: No, no, no, hold on. First of all, just to be clear, what they're talking about is the number of people who weren't allowed to board a plane coming in. So they were stopped at their port of entry, had to get additional clearance, and then take off. There's a big difference. The numbers that we're talking about were the initial group of people that were in transit at the time the executive order was signed. And then there's another group of people -- and the Department of Homeland Security has those numbers up to date on their website -- where they're talking about people that are stopped at the port of entry to ensure that they're properly vetted before they board a plane. There's a very, very delicate distinction between people who were on the plane coming into this country when the executive order was signed, all of who have been vetted and cleared, and the people who have been stopped at a port of entry in one of those seven countries to ensure that the proper vetting took place before they were able to move on. Q Sean, Hallie's question was about civilians that are being targeted by the administration in anti-terror raids. And Zeke's question was about al-Awlaki's daughter. So let me ask you: Is the President willing to kill and target American citizens, even minors, just because their family members are terrorists? MR. SPICER: No American citizen will ever be targeted. Q One more follow-up there. If you're qualified for the position -- you said earlier, if you're qualified for the position, you should get confirmed. That's not how Merrick Garland was treated in the previous administration. MR. SPICER: No, there's never been a situation in which you had a fourth-term -- someone that late in an election cycle. That had never occurred before. And I think that the Senate Republicans were very clear that we should wait and let the voters have a choice, and that's exactly what happened.  As I noted at the beginning of this, 70 percent of people thought that the President's choice for the next Supreme Court was a major decision. That was something he campaigned on. I think when you're that late in a term -- it had never happened before. And the goal was to make sure that the voters had a say in allowing that to happen. And I think that, clearly, it worked. The voters looked at that as a major reason in which they voted for the President. And I think that as we move forward, that's why I think we're going to get the support we need. Q Sean, if the President does get his pick on the bench, what are any specific cases that the administration hopes that the Court takes up in the near future MR. SPICER: Well, there's a lot of cases that I think are in the queue right now that have the potential to be 4-4. I think the idea is to get this individual confirmed as soon as possible just to get the docket moving. That's probably the biggest priority right now. Thank you guys very much. Have a great day. I'll see you tonight. Good luck. Eight o'clock.  END - 1:50 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-02-01,"1:43 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for coming.  Last night, the President was honored to announce Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee to serve as the next justice to the Supreme Court. It was an unbelievably phenomenal evening. Immediately after being announced, Judge Gorsuch was honored to meet with Maureen and Father Scalia. As some of you have reported, his first call after coming back behind the podium was to Merrick Garland, who I would also note has already come out to say that Judge Gorsuch deserves a fair hearing. In less than 24 hours, Judge Gorsuch has already received widespread praise from across the political spectrum as an inspired choice, with sterling academic credentials, a brilliant legal mind, and a steadfast commitment to constitutional principles.  During his long career in public service, Judge Gorsuch has enjoyed bipartisan approval, having previously been confirmed by a voice vote to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. In fact, 12 current Democratic senators -- including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Leahy -- were all in office when he was first confirmed without opposition in 2006.  With as many as eight Democrats, like Senators Blumenthal, Durbin, McCaskill, already supporting a full hearing and vote for Judge Gorsuch, there is no question that he is a widely respected jurist who deserves to have his nomination fairly decided upon by the United States Senate. Now that Judge Gorsuch has been officially named, I hope you all allow me to talk for a moment about how exceptionally qualified he is to succeed the late, great Antonin Scalia. Judge Gorsuch's academic record is impeccable, and as he said last night, the President holds education in the highest regard. Judge Gorsuch graduated Phi Kappa Beta [sic] from Columbia, graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School, and attended Oxford as a recipient of the prestigious Marshall Scholarship. Like Justice Scalia, the cornerstone of Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy is fidelity to the text. He believes that judges should base their decisions solely on the law and the -- he believes -- sorry, I almost screwed that one up -- (laughter) -- he believes his decision should be based solely on the law and the Constitution, not on their own policy preferences or personal feelings. He will be a reliable and principled voice on the bench, preserving equal justice under the law, regardless of background. And I would note, I think -- and I always want to caveat this -- but to my understanding, I think he would be the first justice that will serve with the -- as someone he clerked for on the bench. So it will be a sort of first when he is confirmed by the Senate.  Now, on to the issues of the day. Today is February 1st, which means we are kicking off Black History Month. The President has events planned throughout the month, starting today with a listening session that occurred earlier this morning with African American leaders in the Roosevelt Room. The meeting also included some of the administration's African American appointees. Later today, the President will issue a proclamation. The U.S. Postal Service kicked off the month by issuing the Dorothy Height Forever stamp, the 40th stamp in their Black Heritage series. Dr. Height led the National Council of Negro Women for four decades and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton in 1994 and the Congressional Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush in 2004 -- excuse me, 1994 and 2004. President Obama delivered her eulogy in 2010, and President Trump is now proud that the Post Office is honoring her incredible legacy as a civil rights icon. At events throughout this entire month, we'll celebrate the contributions of courageous African American leaders -- from Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King, Jr., and Clarence Thomas. African American history is American history, and this month is a great reminder of that. Continuing with today's schedule, the Vice President went to the Hill with Judge Gorsuch to meet with lawmakers for the first time since being named last night. On the Hill, the Vice President met with Majority Leader McConnell. And the staff spearheading Judge Gorsuch's nomination will also meet with Senators Cornyn, Grassley, Hatch, and Gardner. With Judge Gorsuch on Capitol Hill, I think it's a good time to talk about the confirmation process. Neither of the two Supreme Court justices that President Obama nominated were subject to the 60-vote threshold of a Senate filibuster. They received bipartisan support because Republicans, despite some political and philosophical differences, viewed them as mainstream and qualified. And Judge Gorsuch should receive the same fair treatment. Also this morning, the President met in the Roosevelt Room with representatives of outside groups to discuss Judge Gorsuch's nomination, including David O'Steen of the National Right to Life; Paula White of the New Destiny Christian Center; Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association; Penny Nance of Concerned Women of America; Charmaine Yoest of American Values; Juanita Duggan of the National Federation of Independent Businesses; Tom Collamore of the United States Chamber of Commerce; Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform; Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society; Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List; and Morton Blackwell of the Leadership Institute. President Trump told the group that his decision on the Supreme Court is among the most important decisions he will ever make as President. He praised Judge Gorsuch for his academic and professional achievements and his lifelong devotion to the law. The attendees thanked the President for making such an inspired choice and for delivering on what was, for many of them, their number one issue in the campaign. They committed vocally to supporting Judge Gorsuch throughout the confirmation process and expressed their desire for the Senate to move swiftly to give him a fair hearing and vote. The meeting closed with the President inviting the group in the Oval Office, which several attendees really enjoyed that honor.  The President then had lunch with Secretary of State designee Tillerson. Mr. Tillerson's tenacity, broad experience, and deep understanding of the geopolitics are going to make him an outstanding chief diplomat for the United States, and the President is looking forward to the full vote of the Senate on his nomination.  Later this evening, the President will participate in a standing legislative affairs strategy meeting with his team, who have been working closely with Congress to enact the President's agenda. So far, between the Vice President and staff, we've had many productive conversations with members of both parties, in both chambers, on a variety of issues, from trade to the President's nomination for the Cabinet and now the Supreme Court.  Now, starting this week, our Legislative Affairs team will also conduct extensive outreach on behalf of Judge Gorsuch's nomination process. Clearly, this administration has made reaching out to Congress a top priority, but you know where I'm going with that: Democrats in the Senate continue to use every tool at their disposal to try and get in the way of the President's attempts to make America great again. Just today, Senate Democrats again refused to even participate in committee votes for Senate [sic]-designees Price and Mnuchin who were moved out of the Finance Committee with zero Democrats present. Democrats also boycotted EPA Administrator-designee Pruitt's hearing. They're doing their constituents and our country a disservice by resorting to these childish tactics. The President's Cabinet nominees will be confirmed on the floor of the Senate, once Democrats actually allow them to get a fair vote. In other Cabinet news, Attorney General-designee Senator Jeff Sessions was voted out of committee today. We look forward to his full vote as the next Attorney General. Additionally, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- designee -- is expected to receive a vote by the full Senate this afternoon. And finally, Veterans Administration Secretary-designee Dr. David Shulkin will go before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs at 2:30 this afternoon. A few more things before I open it up for questions.  In terms of the schedule tomorrow, the President will attend the National Prayer Breakfast and have lunch with Harley Davidson executives here at the White House. The President will also meet with Senator Hatch, Senator Wyden, Congressman Neal and Congressman Brady. Further guidance on all of those meetings will be coming soon. A few personnel announcements. Today, the President sent the following nominations to the Senate: Rachel L. Brand, of Iowa, to be Associate Attorney General; Steven Andrew Engel, of D.C., to be Assistant Attorney General; and Rod J. Rosenstein, of Maryland, to be a Deputy Attorney General. On another note, yesterday we talked about recent reporting concerning the President's executive order protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry. I wanted to draw your attention to some polls that have come out on that subject. For all the hysteria around the implementation of this order, the American people as a whole are very supportive of the action that the President is taking. A new Rasmussen Report polls finds that 57 percent -- which is a clear majority -- of likely U.S. voters favor a temporary ban on refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen until the government can do a better job of keeping these individuals out who pose a threat. A Reuters poll found that 66 percent of Americans believe that the United States should limit the number of refugees into the country. And the safety of the American people and the security of the American homeland are the President's top priorities, and most Americans agree with the steps that he's taking to keep our country safe. Further, today the United Arab Emirates foreign minister voiced his support for the President's decision to take our national security so seriously. The foreign minister also added that he believes the restrictions are not based on religion, but on the ""structural problems"" faced by these nations.  I know that there was a question on Monday regarding Iran's firing of a missile and attack on a navy vessel. I'd like to introduce National Security Advisor General Michael Flynn to provide a quick update. GENERAL FLYNN: Good afternoon, everyone. Recent Iranian actions involving a provocative ballistic missile launch and an attack against a Saudi naval vessel conducted by Iran-supported Houthi militants underscore what should have been clear to the international community all along about Iran's destabilizing behavior across the entire Middle East. The recent ballistic missile launch is also in defiance of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls upon Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology. These are just the latest of a series of incidents in the past six months in which Houthi forces that Iran has trained and armed have struck Emirati and Saudi vessels and threatened United States and allied vessels transiting the Red Sea.  In these and other similar activities, Iran continues to threaten U.S. friends and allies in the region. The Obama administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran's malign actions, including weapons transfers, support for terrorism and other violations of international norms. The Trump administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East, which places American lives at risk. President Trump has severely criticized the various agreements reached between Iran, the Obama administration as well as the United Nations as being weak and ineffective. Instead of being thankful to the United States in these agreements, Iran is now feeling emboldened. As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice.  Thank you. MR. SPICER: Thanks, General. We are going to have a background briefing with NSA staff -- NSC staff, rather, today at 4:00 p.m. here in the briefing room. Further details will be provided on that subject. So thank you, General, with that. As we start off, I mentioned yesterday I'm pleased that we've expanded the briefing room -- at least virtually. And so with that, as I begin to take your question, I'm pleased to offer the first-ever Skype seat question in the White House briefing room to Kim Kalunian from WPRI in Rhode Island. Kim. Q: Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay? MR. SPICER: We can. Q: Great. Just this week, the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island began calling our capital city a sanctuary city. As we know, President Trump's executive order says the White House will begin publicizing a weekly list of these municipalities and pledges to withdraw federal grant money from them. What I'm wondering is, is how soon we can expect to see this list, and how soon should cities like Providence expect to see their federal funding cut? MR. SPICER: Thanks, Kim. I think the President's goal in ending sanctuary cities is pretty clear. We want to, as we mentioned with these other actions, keep America safe. The goal is to make sure on two fronts. One, we are doing everything we can to protect American citizens, institutions, and ending sanctuary cities is one of the ways in which we can continue to do that. Furthermore, the President has been very clear through his executive order that federal funds, paid for by hardworking taxpayers, should not be used to help fund sanctuary cities.  As we continue to implement this executive order and fulfill the pledge that he made, we'll have further updates on how we tend to -- on how that list will come out and when it will come out. So I look forward to following up on that as well. With that, David Jackson. Q: David isn't here but I'll ask a question. (Laughter.) MR. SPICER: Go for it. (Laughter.) Q: Maybe he's on Skype? (Laughter.) Q: The President's daily briefing has been renamed the daily intelligence briefing. Can you tell me how that differs at all from the PDB? Is the President receiving his intelligence briefing in writing or orally, and who is giving it to him? MR. SPICER: He did receive an intelligence briefing today. Congressman -- or Director Pompeo was here. General Flynn, his national security advisor, his briefer. So he receives an intelligence briefing and the PBD every day. Q: Is there any sense that we should get out of the renaming of it from the PDB? MR. SPICER: I think it is a more comprehensive -- again, I think -- we went through this during the transition period, right? There is a difference between the raw intelligence and the analysis, and I think he is constantly updated by his national security team and other intelligence officials. But every single day, he does receive the PBD. And then I think, on top of that, he is receiving intelligence briefings from his team.  Q: But the oral briefing does not necessarily happen every day? MR. SPICER: Well, I can get back to you on that. He does get the PBD every day and on a daily basis meets with his intelligence team, yes. Q: Two quick questions. MR. SPICER: We're not going to do this again. Q: On Black History Month. MR. SPICER: Yeah. Q: Is President Obama being invited to any of the Black History Month celebrations? MR. SPICER: Not that I'm aware of. It's day one. We just started it off. We'll have to get back to you on further details. I think --  Q: And if I may --  MR. SPICER: We have a lot -- there's a lot of activities, as I mentioned, that the President is going to do to celebrate and honor this month. And this was just the first day of the month of February. Q: And today he made the comment about Frederick Douglass being recognized more and more. Do you have any idea what specifically he was referring to? MR. SPICER: Well, I think there's contribution -- I think he wants to highlight the contributions that he has made. And I think through a lot of the actions and statements that he's going to make, I think the contributions of Frederick Douglass will become more and more. Kristen. Q: Thank you. Very quickly, can you clarify what was meant by ""we're putting Iran on notice?"" MR. SPICER: Well, as I mentioned, I think General Flynn and the NSC staff will have a briefing at 4:00 p.m. They can go forward. I'm not going to -- I think we wanted to make very clear that we felt as though that -- their actions were both provocative and a violation, and making sure that they understood that we weren't going to sit by and not act on those actions. Q: Are you building the case to -- MR. SPICER: I'm just -- I'm not going to go any further than that, Kristen. Q: Okay, then let me ask you about -- let me just ask you about the confirmation hearings. How does the President plan to get Chuck Schumer onboard with his pick for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, when he has referred to him as a ""clown"" and accused him of fake tears? MR. SPICER: Well, I think those are two things. I think we're going to -- you look at the support that's already come out. I think there's eight senators already that have talked about the need to have a vote and his qualifications. And not just the Senate but I mean you look at the widespread support that came out for Judge Gorsuch last night across the spectrum. No matter your philosophical view of the Court, I think his qualifications for the Court, his academic background make him an unbelievably highly qualified person. And so it's not just Chuck Schumer; I think the rest of the Senate as he goes up there -- but I think the interesting thing --  Q: Sure --  MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on. I understand that. And I think Chuck Schumer has shown time and time again through this confirmation process with the Cabinet that he's more interested in politics than actually moving the government along. And I think that is troubling. I would ask you that -- I think that the question needs to be asked to Chuck Schumer: Why are you stalling all of these nominees? Why are you insisting on new requirements that you didn't assume for Sotomayor or Kagan? I mean, there's a point at which they need to get asked, why are they obstructing government at every step of the way? There's an element to which they need to be held accountable as well. They held certain standards in place for their nominees, both for the bench and for the Cabinet. And the question is, are they going to live up to the same standards that they imposed on Republicans when they had nominees in a Democratic White House. Q: But does the President think that by personally insulting Chuck Schumer that's a way to get --  MR. SPICER: But again, Kristen, I think the goal is to get -- when -- but again, I would go back. Chuck Schumer is not innocent in this. There's a lot of comments that he's made and a lot of accusations that he's thrown out there and a lot of politics that he's played. At some point, Chuck Schumer needs to be held accountable for his actions and his words.  Blake. Q: Sean, the President today invoked the possibility on the Supreme Court, Sean, of the possibility of going the route of the nuclear option. If it gets to that point, is the White House comfortable with that path? MR. SPICER: Well, I think the President made clear his goal today, which is, number one, he believes that Judge Gorsuch is unbelievably qualified and that he will get nominated -- not only confirmed, but done so with a large bipartisan vote. As I said at the outset, Republicans looked at the qualifications of the two justices that got through in the Obama administration, and while they may not have agreed with their judicial philosophy, definitely agreed that they were qualified on the merits to be confirmed and they did so. I think that we would ask that we be held to the same standard that the Democrats used when they had nominees up. But I think the President made very clear that the decision is something that we would rather not have to go down, but also that it is ultimately up to Senator McConnell and how he wants to operate this. John Gizzi. Q: Thank you, Sean. Just one question today. Leading up to Judge Gorsuch's announcement last night and him coming out after, there were still rumors that Judge Hardiman was going to be nominated and he, in fact, drove to Washington. MR. SPICER: No, actually, John, he didn't. That was media -- that was misreporting. My understanding is that Judge Hardiman never left the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. So with all due respect, I can't be held accountable for reports that falsely stated that he was here. He never was at the White House. My understanding is he had a meeting in eastern Pennsylvania with another judge. But it was -- and, again, I'm not -- I don't track his whereabouts, but my understanding is he never left the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania yesterday. So it was -- we announced when we were going to make this announcement. I think it was a phenomenal way to introduce Judge Gorsuch to the American people and the United States Senate. We invited Democratic leaders, Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Unfortunately, none of them showed up. But it was an opportunity for them and the American people to see an amazing choice that the President made for the bench. Anita. Q: My question, Sean, my question is --  MR. SPICER: You said one, John. Q: But I didn't ask the question. My question is simply this: With the support that he received, the people who called the President, would it be safe to say that Judge Hardiman will be on deck if there is another vacancy soon -- say, Justice Kennedy retiring by the end of the term? MR. SPICER: Well, I think there's a lot of vacancies that we see at the appellate level and throughout the government. He's an impressive, impressive jurist. Obviously the four that really made that final list for the President were unbelievably impressive. So I don't want to get in front of the President. Hopefully he continues to have the President's support and is someone that the President was unbelievably impressed with. So we'll have to see what vacancies come down the pipe. Anita. Q: I know you love when we say we have two questions. I do have two quick questions about something you mentioned at the top. First, you mentioned the three folks that are being nominated to the Department of Justice. Why are they being nominated now, before Senator Sessions is there? Is it because there's a lack of people? Was he consulted? Or is it just because of the whole issue this week with the acting attorney general? MR. SPICER: It's the normal process of getting those -- I've mentioned at a few briefings -- the deputies, the unders, and the actings are in the pipeline. We announced one the other day for Homeland. We've got Commerce was previously announced. And so this is just a continuation of the process to fill --  Q: So would then Senator Sessions -- I mean, in speaking with him --  MR. SPICER: Of course. These are people that he is clearly aware of and supportive of, 100 percent. Q: Okay. And then the second question was, you mentioned tomorrow the meeting with the Harley Davidson executives. There's reporting that he was supposed to go to Milwaukee tomorrow or he was supposed to. That was canceled because of the company. Can you talk about that? MR. SPICER: I just think -- look, it was easier for the executives to come here, considering the week and all of the activity that's been going on. And we figured the easiest thing to do was -- again, no decision had been made about or announced as to what we were doing. We looked at different options and, ultimately, the easiest thing to do in accordance with the President's schedule was to invite them here to Washington to talk about some of the stuff that we've been doing. Q: Are you worried about protesting? MR. SPICER: We're not concerned. I think we're not concerned about that. We're concerned about American jobs, moving this economy forward, and we're excited to welcome them here to Washington to talk about the great work that they do and the many thousands of people that they employ. With that, let me go to the -- we're going to be here a while, guys. We'll go to the second Skype seat. Natalie Herbick from Fox 8 in Cleveland, Ohio.  Natalie.  Q: Secretary Spicer, thank you so much for this rare opportunity. I appreciate it. And I'm learning the ropes. MR. SPICER: Natalie, you're coming back. (Laughter.) Q: And I would like to quickly ask two questions, if I may. The first one being, President Trump has been quick to take action on several issues he's addressed along the campaign trail. And with that in mind, he made a stop here in Cleveland and he said that he would like to make cities like ours the economic envy of the world -- a bold statement. So our viewers would love to know an example, a specific example, as to how he plans to do this sooner than later. MR. SPICER: That's a great question, Natalie. I think it's not just Cleveland but it's Detroit and so many of the other cities around the country. You've heard the President talk about the need to rebuild our inner cities. We were really impressed with Cleveland this past July -- we went there for the national convention -- the people of Cleveland, their desire and the rebound that the city has taken. And I think that when you go to -- whether it's a city like Cleveland or Detroit through different tax and regulatory measures, there's a way that we can continue to bring manufacturing back, we can continue to bring jobs back. And whether it's Harley Davidson or Carrier or Lockheed or Boeing or the GM, Fiat, Ford, these companies, he continues to talk with about how they can bring jobs back, relocate. I think that was, again, another one of the conversations that he had with the pharmaceutical companies yesterday. How can they bring jobs back? How can we ease regulations to do that? So it's about making sure that we have an environment, Natalie, that allows more cities to compete, to grow the manufacturing base, and to recognize the things that we can do, tax-wise and regulatory-wise, to allow that to flourish. Cecilia. Q: Thank you. And Steve Bannon can be heard on recording saying, ""Islam is a dark religion, not a religion of peace, a religion of submission."" Does the President share his chief strategist's apparent beliefs on Islam? MR. SPICER: No, I think the President has been very clear that his number one goal is not to target any one religion but places and areas where we believe that there is an issue. That's what the executive order was all about the other day -- making sure that areas that we don't feel have the proper mechanisms in place to assure the security -- that when they travel to the United States, that we know that they're coming here for peaceful purposes. The President's number-one goal has always been to focus on the safety of America, not the religion. He understands that it's not a religious problem, it's a radicalization problem. There's a big difference between Islam, the religion, and radical Islamic terrorists that come here to seek to do us harm. Q: But nothing about his comment that the President wants to distance himself from or even elaborate on? MR. SPICER: I just think I made it clear that there's a difference between the President's view. Yeah. Q: Thanks. There have been multiple reports of people landing Saturday in the U.S. with valid visas who were denied entry and placed on flights back out of the country. So that's in violation of at least five of these federal judges' orders that came down. Is the White House working to ensure that those people illegally deported can return to the U.S.? And are these court orders causing any second thinking about certain aspects of the order? MR. SPICER: Well, I think that we just -- we issued earlier today some clarification -- an update from the Counsel's Office that clarifies section 3C and 3E that legal permanent residents, LPRs, do not -- that the waiver -- you no longer need a waiver. Initially, as the program was lifting off, the idea was that they would go through, be granted a waiver of which everyone was issued a waiver coming in. In the sake of efficiency, we have interpreted the guidance to all of these agencies to both the Acting Secretary of State, the Acting Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security that the guidance is -- that all individuals are responsible for the administration implementation of this order -- that that does not apply. They no longer need a waiver, because if they are a legal permanent resident, they won't need it anymore. Q: Sean? MR. SPICER: Yeah. Q: On Glass-Steagall, the President during his campaign said that he supported a reestablishing of Glass-Steagall legislation, which would separate the investment banks from the commercial banks. There's legislation on both the House and the Senate side. It's in the Republican program. Mr. Mnuchin when he was queried on the Hill by Senator Cantwell, who is the author of one of the bills, was a little bit more ambiguous on this issue. And I wish you could say something on where this President stands on this. MR. SPICER: I think part of the reason that it's -- we've got to get a Treasury Secretary confirmed. And I think that when we sit here and get asked questions about policy and you go department after department, -- whether it's Treasury, Energy, EPA, HHS, HUD, Education -- the list goes on and on. And so you ask about issues and where the President's agenda is. Well, the reason that the President nominated these highly qualified people was to implement his agenda. And Senate Democrats continue to hold that up. And I think when you -- you can't -- you're asking us about how we're going to move forward on an agenda, whether it's Glass-Steagall or so many other issues. And at the same time, the Democrats are holding up the confirmation of these highly qualified people. Until that occurs, it makes it a heck of a lot harder. Q: But the President -- MR. SPICER: Major Garrett. Q: -- still supports Glass-Steagall. MR. SPICER: The President's position is consistent, yes. Q: Sean, a broad topic I'd like you to take on, which is dissent within the administration, and specifically related to the President's lunch with Rex Tillerson today. More than 1,000 employees at the State Department, Foreign Service officers and others, have signed this dissent-gape. Is it the President's position that Rex Tillerson, when he's confirmed, should go through the formal process, meet with those people, and have a dialogue as previous Secretaries of State have?  And is it the President's point of view that when there is dissent, it can be rooted in a philosophical disagreement that's not necessarily in defiance of his orders and that there can be a dialogue, and that it can maybe inform him differently about policy? MR. SPICER: Sure. I think the President has always -- Q: Because you said a couple days ago they should get out if they -- MR. SPICER: No, no, no, I think there's a difference. Just to be clear on this -- every American has a right to speak their mind. That's one of the amazing beauties of this country. You have the ability to write what you want through our First Amendment, and people have a right to speak out, and that's not hampered. The point that I was making then is that if you believe so deeply that the policy is offensive to you, then you have to understand that the job, the way our government works is we elect a President, and that President gets to carry through their agenda that they set out with the American people during the campaign.  And so they have a right to express it. And I think Secretary Tillerson, for those who have gotten to meet him, has a very open mind and a desire to meet with people and hear ideas, as does the President, as evidenced through what did through the transition, and what he's done since he's become President. He has met with groups, businesses, associations, Republicans, Democrats, independents, that have been supportive of him, that have not been supportive of him. And I think that he's going to continue to do that.  So people have a right to speak their mind, but I think there's a difference between expressing dissent and concern, and not implementing a lawful order, as the acting Attorney General did the other night.  But again, I don't mean to keep coming back to this, but you're asking what we'll do when Rex Tillerson becomes. And part of the problem right now is I can't fully answer your question because Democrats are holding up and slow-walking this nomination. So to presuppose what Rex Tillerson is going to do -- you know, again, I just -- it's ironic that we're being asked what these secretaries will do when they get into office, and the Democrats won't let them assume this, when we all know that the votes are there for them. Q: But I'm just talking about a particular process that has historically been (inaudible) in the State Department. MR. SPICER: I understand that. And I think -- but again, I think for me to presuppose what Secretary-designee Tillerson is going to do prior to him actually getting sworn in, I don't -- he probably will, I don't know. But it would be irresponsible of me to answer a question about what he's going to do before he actually gets sworn in. Q: Thanks, Sean. Senate Democrats have been described as ""bitter"" over the manner in which Judge Merrick Garland was treated when he was nominated for the Supreme Court. Do you feel, does the President feel that that bitterness is well-founded? MR. SPICER: I don't know, I'm not a Senate Democrat. I think they have a right to feel the way they do. I think we've explained our position, both during last year when this was going on, that we felt as though this was up to the voters to make a decision on. And as I pointed out yesterday, so many voters made up their mind based on who they believe the candidates would appoint. Mr. Trump -- then Mr. Trump -- then-candidate Trump, now President Trump was very clear about the type of people that he was going to put forth first in a list of 10 and then in a list of 11 additional ones. So I think the American people knew clearly where he was going to go. He followed through on that campaign promise.  And I think that when you look at the number of people who solely based their vote on that, never mind it was -- and then you expand that, it was pretty clear that that was an important factor in the election.  So I understand it, but I also think that's -- we had an election, it was a major issue in that election, and I think that even when you look across the spectrum -- Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative -- Judge Gorsuch has an unbelievable record and is being praised for that record because of that. Q: I want to ask about Friday, and there's been some reporting that there will be a meeting with President Trump and JP Morgan CEO and others. Can you tell us a little bit more about who else will be there and where things are at on financial reform? What message does the President have for bankers, specifically, on financial reform? We've heard so much about Obamacare and tax reform, but it seems like financial reform has sort of fallen by the wayside. MR. SPICER: Well, I wouldn't agree with that. I think that when you look at regulatory reform and tax reform, and all of the steps that he's been taking to help the economy grow and to create jobs, that's right in that wheelhouse. I hope to have further updates on the schedule for you tomorrow, but I don't now.  Mara. Q: Thank you, Sean. I have question about foreign policy, but I wanted to follow up. You said that LPRs no longer need a waiver, but you didn't answer the question about what about the people who were put on planes, people who were LPRs but would put on planes back to where they came from. What happens to them? MR. SPICER: Well, again, I think then they go through the process. It depends if they're an LPR; if not, then they go through the application process. So if they are an LPR, a legal permanent resident, then they are waived, they can come right through. Q: So they can come back again? MR. SPICER: That's right. But I don't know how many cases that applies to. I know that if they're not a legal permanent resident, then they have to go back. And that's part of this vetting process. Q: Sean -- Q: Wait, my question is about the fighting in Ukraine and Russia-backed rebels are moving the lines forward. And I'm wondering if the President feels that Russia is testing him because this is coming so early in his administration before he's had a chance to fully assemble his team, and what he plans to do about it. MR. SPICER: The President has been kept aware of, through his National Security Council and his national security team as a whole, what's been going on in the Ukraine, and we'll have further updates as we go on. Q: During the campaign last January, Donald Trump promised that on his first day in office he would get rid of gun-free zones in schools and on military bases. When can we expect action on that? And if so, can you share details of what we should expect? MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think you've seen that the President has been very active in terms of getting executive orders out and following up on the campaign pledges that he made to the American people last night, being another example of that. We're going to continue to move through this process, and I think we'll have further updates on where we are with respect to the rest of the EO process.  With that, I want to go to my third Skype seat, Lars Larson of the Lars Larson Show.  Q: Commander Spicer, it's a pleasure. Thanks for your service to America, and thanks for the opportunity. I've got a broad question. The federal government is the biggest landlord in America. It owns two-thirds of a billion acres of America. I don't think the Founders ever envisioned it that way. Does President Trump want to start returning the people's land to the people? And in the meantime, for a second question -- since that's in fashion these days -- can he tell the Forest Service to start logging our forests aggressively again to provide jobs for Americans, wealth for the Treasury, and not spend $3.5 billion a year fighting forest fires? MR. SPICER: Thanks, Lars. I think the President has been very clear that as part of an overall comprehensive energy solution, that we've got to utilize the resources that we have, that the federal government owns, whether that's the forests or natural resources or minerals that exist above and below the ground, that we have too infrequently looked at our own resources and counted too much on foreign sources of energy. So we're going to continue, as Congressman Zinke goes through the process to head up the Interior Department, and Governor Perry goes through his appointment -- his confirmation process, to get those individuals through, but then working together in areas where they have overlap and also on areas where they will act individually to realize, to look at those natural resources that we have and figure out how to best utilize them to benefit not just our energy, but also economic growth opportunities with that. Daniel Happer (ph) Q: I was wondering about executive orders. You haven't really explained why the President is using the executive orders in the manner that he's doing so. Why not take this extreme vetting to Congress and have a congressional bill? And why not -- I mean, what is the philosophy behind -- MR. SPICER: Well, I don't think it's a binary choice, Daniel. I don't think it's ""only do this."" I think he has talked about -- especially in the area of immigration -- he's been very, very clear that this a huge priority for him. And I think that he is going to continue to look at this from a holistic aspect. In other words, visas, visa reform, the wall, our southern border, our northern border -- all of these things that -- you know, vetting. Those are very, very comprehensive. And those things in which he can do through executive order and action, he will. Those things that he can do through working with Congress legislatively, he's going to continue to do as well. Toluse from Bloomberg. Q: The President's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro, told The Financial Times yesterday that he believes that the euro is grossly unvalued, and Germany is benefiting from that and that's why we have a huge trade deficit with Germany and with Europe. Does the President agree with that, that the euro is undervalued? And if so, does he plan to do anything about it? MR. SPICER: I think when it comes to currency valuation, I'm not going to get -- I think we've got a Secretary of Treasury that's in the confirmation process. And once that happens, I think then Secretary Mnuchin will be able to address that, as well.  Q: Sean, Dan Hausle, 7News of Boston. I'd like to ask you about Kelly Ayotte's role shepherding -- MR. SPICER: I was hoping you were going to ask about the Patriots. (Laughter.)  Q: Well, I would like to ask you about that. MR. SPICER: You'll get a second -- (laughter) -- Q: Okay, I'll get a second. But can you talk about Kelly Ayotte's role shepherding Justice Gorsuch around Capitol Hill? MR. SPICER: Sure. Look, Senator Ayotte is someone who's respected on both sides of the aisle. She has a lot of great relationships. She's a former attorney general. She understands the judicial process very well, but she's also -- I mean, this process is a relationship process by and far. You're going around introducing a judge, someone who has not generally been exposed to the legislative process, definitely not the congressional process.  Q: Her relationship with President Trump was stranger in the campaign, and kind of -- MR. SPICER: That's right. And I think that that goes and shows, as I've mentioned several times both through the transition and early, the President is not holding some kind of test about what degree of support you had for him. He wants the best and brightest to continue to serve this country in whatever capacity they can. I think Senator Ayotte very, very helpfully offered up her services. She's got a lot of relationships on both sides of aisle. She's got a tremendous amount of experience in this field. And I think the President thought she was extremely qualified to do this to help shepherd this unbelievably qualified justice through this process. And so she, as well as the team that we've gathered of individuals on staff here, are going to help get Judge Gorsuch through the nomination process. And I would say, just as a side note, that if you look at the amazing job that has been done by the team during the transition and now to get these amazing individuals through the process, despite all of the hype that continues to go about this individual is going to face this problem, or which is the one person -- each of them have really sailed through this process. And story after story says Democrats have tried to land a -- take them out and couldn't land a glove. They're unbelievably qualified. They're unbelievably prepared. And I think that the same process that we followed with this is going to be followed with Judge Gorsuch, and I think we're going to have a very speedy -- Q: As a follow-up -- as an unbiased Rhode Island native, can you offer your Super Bowl pick? And President Trump has also showed quite an affinity for Tom Brady and -- MR. SPICER: I will. I think you know where I come down on that one.  Q: Thanks, Sean. Senators Murkowski and Collins both say they're going to vote ""no"" on Betsy DeVos's nomination. That leaves zero votes to spare. And Vice President Pence would have to cast the tie-breaking vote. So my questions are, how confident are you that you have all of the other Republican senators locked down? And what's the level of concern in the White House that her nomination is going to fail? MR. SPICER: Zero. I am 100 percent confident she will be the next Secretary of Education. She is an unbelievably qualified educator and advocate for students, teachers, parents. I think that the games that are being played with Betsy DeVos are sad. She is someone who's been a tireless advocate over the last couple decades to really support reforms that benefit children. And they are going to be the real winners with her as the Secretary of Education. Sarah Murray. Q: In terms of both the two Republican senators who are voting no on Betsy DeVos and the outcry we saw from Republicans on the Hill last week -- earlier this week about how you guys dealt with the travel ban. First, is there more that the Trump administration and Trump himself should be doing to ensure that his party is on the same page with his priorities? And secondly, on the Yemen raid, can you give us more of an understanding of was there a discussion about the risks involved in this? Was it a straightforward decision? And do you guys still view it to be a success in spite of the death of a Navy SEAL? MR. SPICER: So first, I would just note, Sarah, that I've heard story after story in the last 40 days about how whether -- going back to the last question about these nominees and not getting through. Rex Tillerson was going to go down and so-and-so was going to -- and every one of them, after they got to meet with senators of both sides of the party, have shown why the President chose them -- because they were unbelievably qualified, unbelievably ready to lead and enact an agenda of change in the area of responsibility that they're taking over. And I think the same is going to be true for everyone else who is remaining. Q: But two members of your own party disagree. MR. SPICER: The vote hasn't taken place. I think we've had some concerns in the past and I think when these nominees have met with them and shared with them their thoughts throughout the process -- and, again, you can go back, story after story, and again, each one of these folks who I've heard isn't going to make it, is going to go over the finish line each time. And I think that -- we hear it over and over again and yet we succeed every time. And yet, another roadblock is put up -- well, this person won't succeed. And yet, you look at each one of these people going through the process and it's worked beautifully every time. And I think we're going to continue that path. With respect to Yemen, I think it's hard to ever say something was successful when you lose a life. But you've got to understand that Chief Owens -- he went back, deployed 12 times, because he loved this country and he believed in the mission. And knowing that we killed an estimated 14 AQAP members and that we gathered an unbelievable amount of intelligence that will prevent the potential deaths or attacks on American soil is something that I think most servicemembers understand that that's why they join the service. And so you never want to call something a success, 100 percent, when someone is hurt or killed, and that was the case here, but I think that when you recognize that an individual like this loved this country so much and deployed over and over again because he knew that the mission that he was conducting was so important to our protection, our freedom, our safety. And I know that when the President spoke to Karen, his wife, and talked about the three children that he left behind, she continued to be impressed with -- to impress upon the President, rather, that while it was an unbelievably sad and emotional time for her and her family, that he loved doing this. And so, again, I don't think you ever call anything 100 percent success, but what he did for this nation and what we got out of that mission, I think I truly believe -- and I know the President believes -- it's going to save American lives. With that, let me go to the last question on Skype and then we'll continue. Jeff Jobe of South Central Kentucky -- of the Jeff Jobe Publishing in South Central Kentucky. Jeff. Q: Thank you for allowing me to be part of today's White House press briefing. Clearly, anyone paying attention will see that President Trump is aggressively acting on his campaign promises. This in itself gives hope to my state and particularly the region in which I grew up, Appalachia. We've seen countless politicians make promises at both state and national levels, and not only forget us, but to turn on us. So my question is, how soon or when will the roles restricting coal mining, coal burning and coal exports be reversed? MR. SPICER: Thanks, Jeff. I've talked about this a couple times so far, but I believe -- or the President has very clearly stated that clean coal in particular is an issue that's so important to our energy independence as well as our job creation in this country. And so whether you're talking about Kentucky or West Virginia or Pennsylvania, or so many other places in this country that rely on coal, bringing the production of clean coal back is good for our energy independence, is good for our economy, is good for job creation, and is something that he continues to talk about. And I think once we have the Secretary of Energy confirmed, that we can continue to take steps to move forward with.  Q: Two questions for you. After the primetime announcement last night, it seems like the numbers were good. Do you have a sense that this President will be more aggressive than his predecessors on seeking primetime air play for his announcements? And two, top Democrats are asking the Defense Department to investigate Michael Flynn's possible violation of the Constitution. Do you have a -- it sounds like you saw that story. Do you have a response to that? MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think on the air time issue, that's something that we're not particularly suffering from when it comes to attention. And I think the President does a phenomenal job of getting attention and getting his message out. His use of social media in particular that when you look at the number of people -- I think we had something like 11 million people watching the address on Facebook Live last night. Obviously if we have important issues to discuss with the nation, or announcements to make or nominations, then we'll request time. I don't think that that's something that we've spent a ton of time figuring out. I think we're doing pretty well on that front. And then, I'm sorry, the second question, Mike? Q: The request from Democrats to investigate Flynn for a possible violation of the Emoluments Clause. MR. SPICER: Yeah, so General Flynn, like I think probably countless, if not hundreds, of retired flag officers joins his speaking bureau, and has given speeches at various places. And I think that is something that is kept in practice. And the Department of Defense is the appropriate place for them to review it. But as I said, I think that when you look at so many countless retired flag officers, that's something that generally keeps (inaudible). Zeke. Q: Thanks, Sean. General Flynn, when he was up here, offered some criticism about the Obama administration's handling of Iran in particular. Is that something we should be expecting to hear more from this administration, whether it be on foreign policy or other issues -- criticism of the previous administration going forward? MR. SPICER: I think in area where there's going to be a sharp difference, in particular national security, in contrasting the policies that this President is seeking to make the country safer, stronger, more prosperous, he's going to draw those distinctions and contrast out. But in this particular area, I think the President, when it came to the Iran nuclear deal, was very, very adamant in his opposition to the deal and to its implications.  And so he's going to continue to make sure that the American people know that some of these deals and things that were left by the previous administration, that he wants to make very clear what his position is and his opposition to them. And the action and the notice that he put Iran on today is something that is important, because I think the American people voted on change. Again, this is another issue that he was very clear about. So with that, thank you, guys. I'll see you tomorrow. Take care. Have a good day. END 2:32 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-02-02,"12:32 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Good afternoon. Happy Groundhog Day. We've got six more weeks of winter, apparently. Luckily, for those of you who are going to be joining the President down to Florida this weekend, you'll get some time to get a glimpse of summer at the ""Winter White House"" in Mar-a-Lago. The President is going to start his meeting at 1:00 sharp. You probably just saw the b-roll of folks from Harley rolling on in, literally. So I'm going to try to keep this a little quick. The President signed a proclamation yesterday ushering in Black History Month. He looks forward to an engaging and informative month of events honoring the enormous contributions that African Americans have made throughout our history. Last night, the President was honored to host the swearing-in of the next Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, in the Oval Office. As the President said last night, Secretary Tillerson is a man who's already respected all over the world for the tremendous life that he's led, and now will bring his years of experience to the critical task of making our nation safer, more prosperous, and more secure.  It's time to bring a clear-eyed focus to our foreign affairs, and now with Secretary Tillerson at the helm of the State Department, we'll do just that. We'll strengthen our alliances, form new ones, and enhance America's interests throughout the world.  Speaking of the President's excellent nominees, praise is pouring in from around the country for his pick for Supreme Court. The Detroit News said Judge Gorsuch is a ""legal superstar""; ""an outstanding choice,"" says the New Hampshire Union Leader. The Richmond Times-Dispatch says the ""initial reaction"" was ""to cheer."" The South Florida Sun Sentinel touted his ""excellent qualifications."" Yesterday, Judge Gorsuch had his first round of meetings on the Hill. Unfortunately, Senate offices aren't in the habit of releasing editorials, but from everything we heard, the Judge knocked it out of the park on the Senate as well. The President looks forward to a fair and speedy confirmation process for this exceedingly qualified nominee and jurist.  In my last briefing, I read out a list of the senators Judge Gorsuch met with. In addition to the meeting with Majority Leader McConnell, Majority Whip Cornyn, Judiciary Chairman Grassley, and Senators Hatch and Gardner, the Judge also met with Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Recently, Senator Manchin expressed his belief that Judge Gorsuch could win enough Democrats to hit 60 votes. I'll agree with the Senator there on that one. I mean, we have to have a few Trump-state Democrats who want to win re-election.  But, as I pointed out yesterday, this so-called 60 vote ""standard"" is simply not accurate. Democrats are grasping at straws to block the confirmation of an unquestionably qualified nominee. I'll repeat, neither of the two Supreme Court justices that President Obama put forward were subject to the 60-vote threshold. So although I agree with Senator Manchin that Judge Gorsuch will probably get enough Democrats to get to 60, it's just simply not ever been a requirement. Now, on to the events of today. The President started his day by attending the National Prayer Breakfast. It's a tradition that continued over six decades, going back to President Eisenhower. The President thanked the American people for their faith and prayers that have sustained and inspired him, noting that the five words that he has heard more than any others as he's traveled throughout the country are, ""I'm praying for you.""  He spoke at length about the ISIS genocide against Christians and the oppression of peace-loving Muslims, as well as the threats of extermination against the Jewish people, and made it clear that he believes the United States has a moral obligation to speak out against such violence.  He encouraged Americans to remain a tolerant society where all faiths are respected and where all of our citizens can feel safe and secure. With that goal in mind, the President remarked that he's taken action to ensure that the United States will not allow a beachhead of intolerance to spread throughout our nation. In the coming days, we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty and reject any form of oppression or discrimination.  The President also committed to get rid of the Johnson Amendment and allowing our representatives of faith to speak freely and without retribution. In a particularly poignant moment during his remarks, the President recalled yesterday his visit to Dover Air Force Base to join the family of Chief Ryan Owens as America's fallen hero was returned home. After honoring Chief Owens for giving his life in defense of the American people, the President quoted John 15:13: ""Greater love hath no man than this: that a man lay down his life for his friends."" After returning to the White House this morning, the President held a legislative affairs staff meeting in the Oval Office with his team. The team continues to work closely with Congress to enact the President's agenda. With the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, extensive outreach is underway on Capitol Hill and we look forward to the Judge receiving a swift and fair hearing. Between his meetings, the President was pleased to see that EPA Administrator-designee Pruitt was voted out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. As has unfortunately become the practice, Democrats again boycotted the hearing, requiring a suspension of the rules in order to advance his nomination. Following the strategy session, the President met with Senators Hatch, Wyden and Congressmen Brady and Neal. This meeting was an opportunity for the President to meet with the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee to help chart the future of U.S. trade policy. The President has put together an all-star trade team that will work closely with the U.S. Trade Representative and the committees led by these members to craft new trade deals.  The President has expressed his concern time and again with NAFTA, which he believes is an out-of-date agreement. The ultimate goal is to ensure the best and fairest treatment of U.S. workers and businesses, and the President believes that those interests are best secured by bilateral, rather than multilateral trade deals. He looks forward to working closely with the USTR and Congress when it comes to issues of trade. For those of you who weren't outside and just saw the Harleys roll up, it's no surprise that this afternoon the President will host a meeting and listening session with Harley-Davidson executives and union representatives. For a list of those individuals, please contact our office.  Harley-Davidson has been an American success story since 1901, when William S. Harley, at age 21, completed the blueprint drawing of an engine designed to fit into a bicycle. In 1903, Harley-Davidson began building motorcycles in the United States. And today, the company has approximately 6,000 employees and $6 billion in annual revenue. The company's global headquarters is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- which may have had something to do with them getting in so quickly. And there's a certain staffer. Today, the President will welcome to the White House the latest generation of Harley-Davidson executives to discuss how to make it easier for businesses to create more jobs and factories in the United States. Beyond the company executives, representatives from the machinists and steel workers unions were also be in attendance. Their motorcycles have carried our American servicemembers in war. They carry our police officers that keep us safe. They carry the Secret Service as they protect our presidents. And they bring joy to millions of Americans and throughout the world -- and others throughout the world, rather. The President is looking forward to hosting these leaders from one of America's truly great entrepreneurial success stories. The American worker built this country, and the President is focused on restoring a government that puts their interests first.  A few administrative notes. The National Security Advisor, Mike Flynn, today announced additions to the NSC senior staff. David Cattler will be a Deputy Assistant to the President for Regional Affairs. John Eisenberg, Deputy Assistant to the President, NSC Legal Advisor, and Department [Deputy] Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs. Kevin Harrington, Deputy Assistant to the President for Strategic Planning. And Kenneth Juster, Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs. Lastly, we had a great reaction to our Skype introduction seats yesterday. I know we've had a tremendous amount of requests pouring in from around the country. Please contact the press office if you know of any that has an interest in joining us in the future.  In terms of the schedule for tomorrow, the President will host a Strategic and Policy Forum. Then, in the afternoon, the President will have lunch with General Flynn before departing down to Mar-a-Lago later in the day. With that, I'll take some questions. Katie Pavlich. Q: Hi, Sean. Thanks for the question. Today, President Trump talked about Christian genocide at the National Prayer Breakfast, and last year the Obama State Department officially declared a genocide by ISIS against Christians and other minority and religious groups in the Middle East and North Africa. Now that Rex Tillerson has been sworn in as the Secretary, what specifically is the administration planning to do to comply with the legal obligations of protecting these groups under the U.N. 1948 Treaty? MR. SPICER: That's a great question. I think Secretary Tillerson is learning his way around the building so far this morning. He gave a great speech talking about his vision and goal for the State Department. I think there will be further guidance coming out on that, Katie. Right now, his job is to get in, get settled, talk to the employees, make sure they understood.  But back to the issue, obviously it's important to President. It was during -- throughout the campaign. It's something that he addressed this morning, and is something that he is committed to. He talked about it in terms of the executive orders, and allowing Christian minorities in key countries seek asylum in the United States. He recognizes that, in so many nations, these are the oppressed groups in accordance with how the U.N. defines refugees. So I think you'll see further guidance with that. Jennifer. Q: Thanks, Sean. I have two questions, actually. Today, the President renewed his promise to protect religious liberty, which he says is under threat. Some Americans see religious liberty as code for discrimination. Can you kind of give us a sense of how the President views this tension? MR. SPICER: It's an interesting question, because I do -- you know, this is something that comes up quite a bit. I think there is a line. We have freedom of religion in this country, and I think people should be able to practice their religion, express their religion, express areas of their faith without reprisal. And I think that pendulum sometimes swings the other way in the name of political correctness.  And I think the President and the Vice President both understand that one of the things that makes our country and this democracy so great is our ability to express our religion, to believe in faith, to express it, and to live by it. And that's where I think the important part is -- whether it's a small business owner or employee, he wants to have some degree of expression of faith at the company. And too often those voices get pushed out in the name of political correctness.  So he's going to continue to make sure that we not only speak up for it, but find ways in which we can keep that line a little less blurred and make sure that the pendulum doesn't swing against people. We shouldn't impose a religion on anybody. We're free to express our religion or be -- you know, not have one. That's obviously, in our country, an equally valid way of living your life. But at the same time, I think people who want to express their faith shouldn't be ostracized because they want to live that.  Major. Q: If you could give us an example, if you could, of the pendulum swinging in the direction of political correctness. And how is that going to inform the President with this executive order? And as you may know, a draft is circulating around town and many have wondered if that is going to be a way to either silence those on the left or be a threat to the LGBTQ community. Talk us through both of those. MR. SPICER: Well, I think if you look back to the Little Sisters case, if you look back to other businesses that were, under Obamacare -- Q: Would you put Hobby Lobby in that category? MR. SPICER: I would, yeah. Absolutely. I think there's several businesses and several institutions -- Catholic institutions and others -- that have been mandated or attempted to mandate certain things that they may or may not do or how they have to treat their employees. Those are instances where clearly the pendulum is swinging a different way, where you are not carving out institutions or the ability for privately held businesses to conduct themselves to live according to their faith or their moral compass.  And so there's clearly a lot of evidence in the last couple years of the government coming in with regulations and policies that have, frankly, denied people the ability to live according to their faith. Q: From the President's point of view, that's discriminatory in itself. MR. SPICER: Well, I think there's -- like I said, I think it's a pendulum. And where the President is, is that he wants to make sure that you don't penalize someone for wanting to express their faith, and that to the extent that we can keep that line a little less blurred and allow people who don't believe in a faith or have an opposing faith, make sure that they are equally comfortable in the workplace. But we shouldn't penalize people or mandate them to abide by certain policies or regulations which are in direct contradiction to their faith. Q: And what about the executive order, Sean?  MR. SPICER: There's right now no executive orders that are official or able to read out. We maintain that there's nothing new on that front.  Q: (Inaudible) drafted along -- MR. SPICER: It's not a question of -- there are a lot of ideas that are being floated out -- I mentioned this the last couple days. But that doesn't mean -- part of it is, as the President does all the time, he asks for input, he asks for ideas, and on a variety of subjects there are staffing procedures that go on where people have a thought or an idea and it goes through the process. But until the President makes up his mind and gives feedback and decides that that's final, there's nothing to announce.  Q: Thank you. In light of the tragedy that happened in Quebec City last week, which Prime Minister Trudeau is actually calling an act of terrorism, what is the President doing, what initiatives is he taking to make sure that that kind of homegrown -- because he was a Canadian citizen -- homegrown terrorism, homegrown violence doesn't happen within our country? MR. SPICER: Well, there's a lot of things. Number one, he's talked cyber -- I mean, he's looking at it from every angle. I think the first thing is to make sure that we look at our borders. You've got to protect your own people first, then you've got to look at the cyber threats. I mean, so there is a holistic approach to both immigration and there's a direct nexus between immigration and national security and personal security that he has to look at.  But then it's a multi-tiered step. You look at the borders, you look at who we're letting in, and you also look at what we're doing internally with our intelligence agencies and the FBI that make sure that we're looking at -- whether it's the cyber threats that we face or other terrorist activities -- but making sure that we're working with the NSA and the FBI to be ahead of the curve, if you will. Q: If I may, these are homegrown -- Oklahoma City was an American kid. MR. SPICER: Sure. Q: Okay. That's all. That's what I'm asking. MR. SPICER: That's what I'm saying. But I think that, part of it is, looking at using the assets that we have here -- the NSA, the FBI -- looking at using the different agencies to see if we can get ahead of the curve and see things. And a lot of times, that's been a very big issue, is getting ahead of the curve for when there are telltale signs, having the reporting systems up, working with the various agencies. But it's a multi-effort process, if you will. Kristen. Q: Sean, thank you. Why is the administration easing sanctions against Russia? MR. SPICER: We're not easing sanctions. The Treasury Department -- it is, from what I understand, it's a fairly common practice for the Treasury Department, after sanctions are put in place, to go back and to look at whether or not there needs to be specific carve-outs for either industries or products and services that need to be going back and forth. But I would refer you back to the Treasury Department on that one. Q: Hold on, Sean. The language on the Treasury Department website suggests that you are, in fact, easing sanctions that authorizes certain transactions with the Federal Security Service. Does that not suggest a shift from what was put in place --  MR. SPICER: No, it doesn't.  Q: So explain --  MR. SPICER: It is, from what I understand, a regular course of action. The Treasury does, quite often, when there are sanction imposed, but I would refer you back to the Treasury Department. Q: Thank you. Could I ask you to describe the tone of the call on the weekend between the Australian Prime Minister and the President, and also outline the President's concerns about the refugee deal in question? And I asked you this earlier this week, but could you clarify whether the deal is on or not? Because the President tweeted last night ""I will study this dumb deal,"" implying that he's still considering it.  MR. SPICER: Right. The President had a very cordial conversation with Prime Minister Turnbull, where they went through an extensive discussion of this deal. The President is unbelievably disappointed in the previous administration's deal that was made and how poorly it was crafted, and the threat to national security it put the United States on. He has tremendous respect for the Prime Minister and for the Australian people, and has agreed to continue to review that deal and to ensure that as part of the deal, which was always part of it, that we would go through a very, very extreme vetting process to ensure that every single person that is being offered up is coming here with peaceful intentions and poses no threat to the United States.  So he has ensured that while he has respect for the Australian people and respect for Prime Minister Turnbull, that we do not pose a threat to the United States of America, that the deal that was cut by the last administration is something that he is extremely, extremely upset with. He does not like it, but out of respect for him, he's going to allow that process -- continue to study it and allow it to move forward under the conditions that have been set -- that there will be extreme vetting on every single one of those individuals. Q: Just for clarity, the deal itself is still under review, so it's not certain to proceed? Or it will proceed as --  MR. SPICER: Part of the deal was that -- the deal allows for the United States to vet the individuals that are being offered up to be processed. The President's goal is to make sure that every single one of those people, in accordance with the deal and as discussed in the telephone conversation with the Prime Minister, is subject to extreme vetting to ensure that no one puts it. But I cannot underscore how disappointed he was in the deal that was made and how he thought it was just a horrible deal that was offered up by the United States by the previous administration. Sarah. Q: The President and his national security advisor have been clear the administration wants to put Iran ""on notice,"" but they haven't specified what that is. What options are on the table? And are there any options, like military action, that might be off the table at this point? MR. SPICER: So I think General Flynn was really clear yesterday that Iran has violated the Joint Resolution, that Iran's additional hostile actions that it took against our Navy vessel are ones that we are very clear are not going to sit by and take.  I think that we will have further updates for you on those additional actions, but clearly we wanted to make sure that Iran understood that they are on notice, this is not going un-responded to. John. Q: Thank you very much, Sean.  Q: It was a Saudi vessel.  MR. SPICER: Thank you. Yes. Q: They thought it was an American, but it's a Saudi vessel. MR. SPICER: Right, that's right. John. Q: Thank you, Sean. On January 27th, at the Republican retreat in Philadelphia, Vice President Pence had a closed-door meeting with House Republicans where several of them brought up the case of IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. There was an attempt to impeach him last year, which some of the leadership in the House felt was unfair to the commissioner, and they urged him to tell the President that given his entire record, he should fire him or ask for his resignation soon. My sources said the Vice President said ""I can hear you."" Is there any pending action on the fate of Commissioner Koskinen? MR. SPICER: I have nothing to update you on.  Hallie. Q: On Yemen, it was initially described, the raid over the weekend, as a successful raid by the administration. There are now some questions and comments raised about the possibility of additional civilian casualties. So I've got a couple of questions for you on this one. Would you still stand by your characterization of the raid as ""successful""? Was the President given multiple options about this raid, or just one? And were there consultations with the prior administration's national security officials, military officials about the raid moving forward? MR. SPICER: Thank you. Actually, I'd like to just walk through that. I appreciate you bringing this up. There is -- let's go through the tick-tock on that raid. On November 7th, CENTCOM submitted the plan to DOD. Clearly, that was under the last administration. Legal teams were involved immediately when it was submitted to DOD. On December 19th, the plan was approved by the Department of Defense and recommended that it be moved ahead. It was sent then to the National Security Council staff here in the White House. Again, this all happened under the previous administration. On January 6th, there was an interagency deputies meeting. The deputies recommended at that time that they go ahead. It was so easily approved it was sent straight up. The conclusion to hold was, at that time, to hold for what they called a ""moonless night,"" which, by calendar, wouldn't occur until then-President-elect Trump was President Trump. On January 24th, shortly after taking office, Secretary of Defense-then Mattis read the memo, resent it back up to the White House conveying his support. On the 25th of January, the President was briefed by General Flynn on Secretary Mattis's recommendation and the status of the operation, or potential operation. The President asked to see Secretary Mattis and Joint Chiefs of Staff Dunford. He then, on that evening, had a dinner meeting, which included the President, the Vice President, Secretary Mattis, Chairman Dunford, Chief of Staff Priebus, Jared Kushner, Chief Strategist Bannon, General Kellogg, General Flynn, and CIA Director Pompeo where the operation was laid out in great extent. The indication at that time was to go ahead on Friday the 26th.  In the morning, the deputies committee met again. It was not a necessary step because they had previously recommended and also reaffirmed their support for that. On January 26th, the President signed the memo authorizing the action.  So it was a very -- not only was it a very, very though-out process by this administration, it had started back on November 7th in terms of -- clearly well before that, but it was a move forward by CENTCOM on November 7th. This was a very, very well thought-out and executed effort. Q: Where was the President the night of the raid? How did he learn about Chief Owens's death? And do you still stand by your characterization that it was successful?  MR. SPICER: The President was here in the residence. He was kept in touch with his national security staff. Secretary Mattis and others had kept him updated on both the raid and the death of Chief Owens, as well as the four other individuals that were injured. So he was kept apprised of the situation throughout the evening.  And again, I think -- I would go back to what I said yesterday: It's hard to ever call something a complete success when you have the loss of life, or people injured. But I think when you look at the totality of what was gained to prevent the future loss of life here in America and against our people and our institutions, and probably throughout the world in terms of what some of these individuals could have done, I think it is a successful operation by all standards. And again, I want to reiterate, it is tough to ever use the word ""success"" when you know that somebody has lost their life. But when you go back and look at an individual that dedicated their life to serving this country, and went over and over and over again knowing that this not only the risk that he took but wanted to do it because he knew the threat that these kind of individuals pose to our country and to our people, that's -- while not a success that you lost to him, you know that he died in sacrifice for someone else here in this nation. Hunter Walker.  Q: Thank you, Sean. I've seen some criticism of the President's remarks at the prayer breakfast this morning. Can you shed any light on why he thought that was a good venue to mock ""The Apprentice"" for its ratings? MR. SPICER: Look, Mark Burnett, the creator of ""The Apprentice,"" who is a long-time supporter of the prayer breakfast but also has a personal relationship, was there. He meant it as a light-hearted moment. And I think if you look at the totality of his remarks, they were absolutely beautiful. And I think to hone in on that, it was a light-hearted moment he was trying to have with a big supporter of the National Prayer Breakfast and a personal friend. Guys, I'll be out tomorrow. I want to make sure we all get to see the President now. Thank you, guys. END 12:57 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-02-03,"12:37 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everyone. Happy Friday. It's another busy day here at the White House and across the Trump administration.  The first jobs report under the President's administration was released this morning. It's National Wear Red Day, highlighting the importance of preventing heart disease. It's National Catholic Schools Week. And the President is going to be signing some executive orders, delivering some much-needed regulatory relief to lenders and borrowers in the next few minutes. We're finishing up the second week here really strong. Yesterday, another great deal was reached with Lockheed Martin for the purchase of a new lot of F35s. Through the President's intervention, a total of 90 planes -- for a lot of 90 planes; 55 were purchased for U.S. military that added up to a total of $455 million savings for U.S. taxpayers from the previous lot, with an average cost reduction of 7.5 percent, another big win that the President has delivered on for U.S. taxpayers. Speaking of good numbers, let's turn to the jobs report. The economy added more than 227,000 new jobs, significantly more than the 175,000 that had been expected. Today's report reflects the consumer confidence that the Trump presidency has inspired. According to a recent Gallup poll, economic confidence is at a new high, and ADP showed strong private sector hiring. President Trump campaigned on how to make America work again. Even before he took office, the markets knew he would deliver on that promise. The President has already taken significant steps to turn our economy around, and he's looking forward to ensuring that every American who wants a job has the opportunity to find one. While the President is definitely pleased that the job growth has far surpassed expectations and that the labor force participation is rising, he also recognizes that there's a lot more work to be done. The President has a big and bold agenda to grow the U.S. economy and to create jobs. In just his first two weeks in office, he's met with more than 50 business leaders across a vast range of industries. This morning, the President participated in a strategic and policy forum with business leaders from some of our country's most successful companies. The President understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders on how to make the nation's economy stronger. His firsthand experience as a successful businessman helps to guide his decisions as President, and he will continue to seek opinions of other job creators while crafting an economic agenda. All of these meetings are focused on one primary goal: providing new and improved employment opportunities for all Americans. We're looking at a full range of policy measures to achieve that goal: regulatory relief, tax and trade reform, empowering women in the workplace, rebuilding America's crumbling infrastructure, and improving our education system.  Also today, in pursuit of that goal, the President will be signing two executive actions as part of his plan to overhaul our financial and regulatory system. I expect that to happen closer to the one o'clock hour. The first is an executive order for posing guideline principles that sets the table for a regulatory system that mitigates risk, encourages growth, and more importantly, protects consumers.  The Dodd-Frank Act is a disastrous policy that's hindering our markets, reducing the availability of credit, and crippling our economy's ability to grow and create jobs. It imposed hundreds of new regulations on financial institutions while establishing unaccountable and unconstitutional new agency that does not adequately protect consumers. Perhaps worst of all, despite all of its overreaching, Dodd-Frank did not address the causes of the financial crisis, something we all know must be done. It did not solve the ""too big to fail,"" and we must determine conclusively that the failure of a large bank will never again leave taxpayers on the hook. The presidential memorandum addresses the burdens of government regulations and the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. The rule is a solution in search of a problem. There are better ways to protect investors, and the Trump administration is taking action to do so. We're directing the Department of Labor to review this rule. The rule's intent may be to have provided retirees and others with better financial advice, but in reality, its effect has been to limit the financial services that are available to them.  President Trump does not intend to put unnecessary limits on economic opportunity. The Department of Labor exceeded its authority with this rule, and this is exactly the kind of government regulatory overreach the President was put into office to stop. We desperately need to overhaul how we approach financial regulation. The President is taking action to protect American taxpayers and get people back to work. Moving on, we announced earlier this week that we would be taking steps to address Iran's recent actions. Today, the U.S. sanctioned 25 individuals and entities that provide support to Iran's ballistic missile program and the Islamic Revolutionary Quds Force. These designations are in response to Iran's ongoing ballistic missile program, including its ballistic missile test on January 29, 2017, as well as Iran's continued support for terrorism. We've taken these actions today, after careful consideration, and will continue to respond with appropriate action. These designations mark yet another stop in our continued effort to aggressively target Iran's ballistic missile program and terrorism-related activities. Over at the Department of Defense, Secretary Mattis is on the final day of a two-day trip through Asia. He visited Korea yesterday and Japan today, returning to Washington tomorrow. Secretary Mattis's visit emphasizes the priority President Trump places on the Asia-Pacific, and on strengthening the U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance in the face of a growing North Korea nuclear and ballistic missile threat. Over in the Senate, the President now has 11 Cabinet nominees awaiting a full Senate vote on their confirmations. We look forward to welcoming these individuals into the administration. Regarding the weekend's plans, the President will debut his second weekly Facebook Live event this evening at 5 o'clock. You can expect him to recap another week of action on behalf of the American people. He'll also comment on his selection of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. And while recognizing Black History Month, he will discuss his vision to deliver more opportunity and safety for the African-American community. One more note of this week's address: the lead-in to the President's remark on Facebook Live will feature some of the incredible artwork throughout the White House that was created by African American artists, so you definitely don't want to miss this. As I mentioned previously, this weekend the President will be shifting the operation of the White House down to the ""Winter White House"" at Mar-a-Lago. While in Florida, he'll hold meetings and calls with advisors and staff to plan for another big week of action on behalf of the American people. We'll provide readouts of these as they occur. By our count, as of this morning the administration has already racked up more than 60 significant actions: 21 executive actions, 16 meetings with foreign leaders, and 10 stakeholder meetings, to name a few.  We're looking forward to another productive week next week. On Monday, the President will visit Central Command and Special Operations Command Headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base. While at MacDill, the President will receive command briefings from both CENTCOM and SOCOM, have lunch with the enlisted troops, and have an all-hands address to personnel. General Dunford and General Flynn will also be present for the meetings, and the President will return to Washington that evening. With that, I'm going to go my first Skype question seat. Jackie Nespral from NBC 6 in South Florida. Jackie. Q: Good afternoon. On behalf of the viewers of South Florida, thanks so much for this opportunity. You know, a lot of focus on foreign affairs this week, a new sanctions announced today against Iran, and of course Miami, as you know, is home to the largest Cuban-American community in the country. And during the campaign, President Trump talked about his discontent with the warming of U.S.-Cuba relations implemented by President Obama. And in the last days of his administration, he ended the ""wet foot, dry foot"" policy, leaving thousands of Cubans in limbo. So my question is twofold. A, has there been any contact between your administration and the Cuban government? And B, are there any plans to change the current policy right now? MR. SPICER: Thanks, Jackie. We are in the midst of a full review of all U.S. policies towards Cuba. The President is committed to an agenda of ensuring human rights for all citizens throughout the world. And as we review those policies in Cuba, that will be forefront in their policy discussions, but there is nothing that we have on that front at this point. Francesca Chambers. Q: Thank you, Sean. Today, the United States put new sanctions on Iran. Previously, this morning, the President had said that they were playing with fire. You said that appropriate actions would continue to be taken. Is this the full extent of the punishing actions that we're seeing right now? And are military options still on the table in response to the administration saying that all options are on the table? MR. SPICER: Thanks for the question. I think one of the things that the President has said throughout the campaign, during the transition, and since becoming President is that he doesn't like to telegraph his options. That's how he believes that you can have a much greater successful option.  So I'm not going to go into the full extent, and I think today's sanctions really represent a very, very strong stand against the actions that Iran has been taking and make it very clear that the deal that they struck previously was not in the best interest of this country, and that President Trump is going to do everything he can to make sure that Iran is stayed in check. Q: So it is possible that there are more actions coming, though? MR. SPICER: I just -- I would never rule anything off the table. I think the President has made it clear throughout his time that that's what going to happen. Jeff. Q: Thanks a lot, Sean. I wanted to ask about one of the members that has been announced as being part of President Trump's team -- it's Gina Haspel. Senator Ron Wyden has written to the President saying that her background makes her unsuitable to be the CIA Deputy Director. And what he was specifically referencing was her role in the enhanced interrogation program that the CIA had during the course of the Bush administration. Do you believe that this background is a disqualifier for that position? MR. SPICER: I think she has had an unbelievably distinguished career as a covert operative. She basically gave up that to come out and serve in this role at the request of Director Pompeo, and I think she has been a very, very distinguished servant to the American people and is highly qualified for that position. Next, I'm going to go to Josh McElveen over at -- from WMUR in New Hampshire. Q: Hey, Sean, thanks for taking the question. I know you're looking forward to the Patriots coming down in a couple of months -- a lot of people up here are hoping that happens as well. Getting to business, though, for more than two years, the number-one public health and safety threat facing this state is the heroin and opioid crisis. During the campaign, the President promised to be swift and aggressive when it came to this problem -- stopping the flow of drugs coming across the border. Increasingly, though, the problem lies in synthetic fentanyl being cooked up in labs in the northeast. What is the administration doing on that front as well as the treatment aspect of addiction?  And secondly, if I may, with the understanding it is a state issue, New Hampshire is poised to become a ""right to work"" state, but the vote is expected to be close. Given the administration's favorable view of ""right to work,"" is it actively engaged in that effort? And if not, what is the general message from the White House? MR. SPICER: Thanks, Josh. First, on the opioid crisis, that is a major problem for not just New Hampshire but for so many states across the country. I think one of the things beyond the health issue is to make sure that we're looking at borders use. And the flow of heroin through our southern border is something that the President obviously takes -- that's part of his whole strong immigration stance, strong border security, having that wall built, having additional assets on the southern border will go a long way to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the country from our southern border up through the states. It was obviously, as you mentioned, a big issue that he made in New Hampshire throughout the primary and continued so on the campaign. And that's something that as soon as Tom Price and others are confirmed throughout the department, this has got a health component to it, it's got a border issue to it. So there is a multi-government approach that needs to be taken to the opioid crisis.  With respect to right to work, I think you accurately portrayed it. The President believes in right to work. He wants to give workers and companies the flexibility to do what's in the best interest for job creators. Obviously, the Vice President has been a champion of this as well. It's something that is a big deal in Indiana and something that he has championed as well. Blake. Q: Sean, I want to ask you about Dodd-Frank. Beyond the executive order that's going to be signed here momentarily, is the administration planning on or working with Congress to overturn certain portions of the law itself that can be done with an executive order? If so, what might that be? What might that timeline be? And can you say if a full repeal of Dodd-Frank is actively being considered or not? MR. SPICER: Well, I think there's two aspects of this. There's the administrative piece, which he's starting to address through executive action, and then there's a legislative piece that I think we're going to work with Congress on. But I mean, I think I'd go back to what I said earlier -- that Dodd-Frank has been both a disaster in terms of the impact that it's had, but also it hasn't achieved the goal. And I think that there's no question that the President talked about this extensively, the impact that it's had. And it's not an either-or. It's, frankly, just not doing what it set out to do. And so I think we're going to continue not just to act through administrative action, but through working with Congress and figuring out a legislative fix. Major Garrett. Q: Sean, meeting with the Australian ambassador here yesterday with Chief of Staff Priebus and Steve Bannon -- can you describe what that meeting was about? And did the administration make a commitment -- which we heard from the State Department yesterday -- that, in fact, all of those subject to the Obama administration agreement are still possible refugee re-settlers just with extreme vetting or some sort of process? What was communicated?  And on the Iran sanctions, Adam Szubin is the Acting Treasury Secretary. He was, of course, in charge of sanctions at the Treasury Department before. Oftentimes these are a long time in development. Were these sanctions something that were kind of on his desk or have been identified, and that's what made them so, if not easy, available to enact so rapidly? MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think those are -- I think you correctly pointed out -- I mean, he served in the last administration. These kind of sanctions don't happen quickly, but I think the timing of them was clearly in reaction to what we've seen over the last couple days. We knew we had these options available to us because they had been worked through the process, but we acted swiftly and decisively today because the timing was right. So they were in the pipeline, they had been staffed and approved, and the President made the decision that now was the time to do it based on recent action. Chief of Staff Priebus and Chief Strategist Bannon did meet with the Prime Minister yesterday. I think they had a very productive --  Q: The ambassador. MR. SPICER: The ambassador. Thank you. Appreciate the correction. They did have a very productive and candid conversation. We have a tremendous amount of respect for the people of Australia, for Prime Minister Turnbull, and it was a follow-up on the call. But we're going to continue to work through this. We're going to honor the commitments that we've made in some way, meaning that we are going to vet these people in accordance with the agreement that happened. And we'll continue to have further updates as we do. John Roberts. Q: Sean, your statement last night on settlements in Israel -- has there been a shift in U.S. policy? While you said that you didn't think that they were helpful to achieving peace, you also didn't think that they were an impediment to peace, which would represent a departure from both Obama and Bush. And there was no reaffirmation of a two-state solution in that statement. So where are you on that? MR. SPICER: The President is committed to peace. That's his goal. And I think when the President and Prime Minister Netanyahu meet here on the 15th, that will obviously be the topic on that. At the end of the day, the goal is peace. And I think that's what you have to keep in mind. I think that is going to be a subject that they discuss when they meet on the 15th, and that's as far as I want to go on that. Q: Sean, back to the settlement thing. What is your position on settlements in terms of whether or not they -- I mean, you said that they were not an impediment to peace, but you also don't want them building new ones.  MR. SPICER: Right. Q: So where are you --  MR. SPICER: I mean, I think the statement is very clear about that. We don't believe that the existence of current settlements is an impediment to peace, but I think the construction or expansion of existing settlements beyond the current borders is not going to be helpful moving forward. Trey.  Q: Two for you. Seventeen members of Congress requested that President Trump not interfere with the current way unemployment is calculated by the Department of Labor. Does the President intend to comply with their request? And a related question -- how many of the 227,000 jobs added to the U.S. in January does the President attribute to his administration versus the Obama administration? MR. SPICER: I think, look, when you look at the confidence indexes, I'm not going to get into -- unfortunately, we don't have that kind of a breakdown. I think that you've seen the actions that he's taken, whether it's Carrier or some of the other companies -- Sprint, SoftBank. Clearly there is a desire for companies to want to come be part of this Trump agenda and build and manufacture, create jobs, bring jobs back. But I'm not at liberty to start parsing the BLS and other reports as far as where that comes down.  But look, his team, led by Gary Cohn, was really pleased with the numbers this morning. Obviously, we're pleased that we're -- 227,000 jobs is a great kickoff. We hope they get better. We know that there's a lot more work to do, and that's why the President continues to meet with business leaders, union leaders to help figure out how we can grow the economy. Ashley. Q: The government revealed in an Alexandria court case today that over 100,000 visas have now been revoked as part of the President's travel ban. Does that include visa holders who are already in the United States? And will the government begin finding them and trying to deport them? MR. SPICER: I'll have to get back to you on that. I don't have all the details on that right now. Q: Six hours ago, the President tweeted that professional anarchists, thugs and paid protestors are proving the point of millions of people who voted to make America great again. Does the administration have any intention of investigating the groups who have been rioting at conservative or pro-Trump events? MR. SPICER: I think we know who they are. I don't know that we need to do an investigation. Q: Has the President seen the letter sent from Senator McCain yesterday? And if so, is he looking into arming the Ukrainians? MR. SPICER: I don't know. I'll have to get back to you on that. Charlie. Q: Ambassador Nikki Haley came out with a strong statement on Russia yesterday. Does the administration have plans to keep the sanctions against Russia in place, or do they have any intention of adding more sanctions? MR. SPICER: So there's two things. One, I think I commented the other day on the sanctions that Treasury put out. Those are, in fact, routine -- or the clarification -- they are a routine clarification that occurs. With respect to the sanctions, I think Ambassador Haley made it very clear of our concern with Russia's occupation of Crimea. We are not -- and so I think she spoke very forcefully and clearly on that.  If I can, I'd like to go to the third Skype question. Christopher Sign from ABC15 in Arizona. Q: Sean, thank you for doing this. Hello from a sunny and beautiful Phoenix. With the likely confirmation on the horizon with a new Veteran Affairs Secretary, there has been discussion regarding privatizing the VA. There's also still concerns regarding wait times, even overall care and some reports regarding a suicide rate. What is the reform that the administration is seeking here? Also, will the administration protect whistleblowers?  Second part of the question -- we've seen protests here in Phoenix, as in the nationwide as well. When you talk about unity, what is the administration doing to bring more unity to the nation, and even more transparency? As here in Phoenix, we saw that secret meeting on the tarmac. How is the administration repairing all of this? MR. SPICER: Thanks, Chris. First, I mean, I think the President, mostly through deed, continues to show that he wants to bring people together in this country, figure out how to move the country forward, both economically, job-wise. I think that is something that he continues to show a desire for. He talked about it in his inaugural address and the prayer breakfast.  So I think he's going to continue to show through both word and deed his desire to move the country forward. I'm trying to think -- can you go back to the first part? Q: That's all right -- the confirmation -- the likely confirmation of the VA Secretary.  MR. SPICER: Oh yeah, Dr. Shulkin. Yeah, look, I think first and foremost on VA reform, the number one thing is to get Dr. Shulkin confirmed. And so many of these, as I brought up in the past couple days, it's hard to talk about how we're going to enact an agenda of reform when Senate Democrats continue to slow-walk some of these folks. And I think that's a big problem. Dr. Shulkin is the right individual to reform the VA -- to understand whether it's lending or medical care, the problems and the challenges that we face at the VA. These are people who have served our nation and deserve the best care they can get, whether that's the mortgage lending, health care, or the variety of other stuff that the VA serves or provides to our veterans. And I think that what the President has done is talk to people like Dr. Toby Cusgrove at Cleveland Clinic and other business leaders about providing a better approach to serving the needs of our veterans.  Right now, you're right, there are still wait times that are unacceptable. There's care that's unacceptable. We've got to address that, and he's going to continue to do it. David Jackson. Q: Sean, during the campaign, candidate Trump repeatedly said he was going to void the Iranian nuclear deal. Bottom line -- is he going to do that, or is he going to let it stay? MR. SPICER: I think today's action speaks for itself in terms of the sanctions. He's made it very, very clear, David, that the deal that was struck was a bad deal, that we gave Iran too much and we got too little for it. And I think that he is going to continue to be tough on Iran in a way that wasn't done in the last eight years. I think today's actions and the way that we expedited those sanctions are another example of how he's going to stay tough on them. Let me go to the fourth Skype seat. Dale Jackson from WVNN Talk Radio in Huntsville, Alabama. Q: Sean, thank you very much for taking questions from outside the elite media bubble there in D.C. My question is about immigration. Donald Trump made this the forefront of his campaign, the foundation of it, yet the DACA and DAPA programs still exist. And I learned from a member of Congress yesterday that the Trump administration is still issuing the work permits that (inaudible) individuals.  Question one is, when are these programs going to be ended? And question two, when will they stop issuing work permits to these individuals? MR. SPICER: Thanks, Dale. I think as you know, Secretary Kelly just assumed office. We are reviewing these programs. We've made it very clear that we'll have further updates on immigration referring to DACA and DAPA. The President has made significant progress on addressing the pledge that he made to the American people regarding immigration problems that we face, and I think we're going to see more action on that in the next few weeks.  Yes, sir. Q: Sean, yesterday the President described NAFTA as a catastrophe. We've heard about his concerns with Mexico, but I'm wondering if you can outline some of the irritants that he finds along the Canadian border, and if there's any talk of a meeting with Prime Minister Trudeau. MR. SPICER: I think he has spoken to Prime Minister Trudeau. I know that they're looking at setting up a time to come down. We've been in constant contact with Canadian officials, and I think that will be a meeting that is set up very shortly. Sarah. Q: Thanks, Sean. Russia's foreign minister has pressed the administration for further details on the President's plans to establish safe zones in Syria. The President has said to have discussed this yesterday with King Abdullah. When can we expect further details on that plan? MR. SPICER: That's a good question. I think that we are -- as you noted in the readouts from last weekend, that has been a subject that has come up with all of the Middle East leaders that he's talked about. It's an area that he feels strongly about. And I think as he continues to have follow-up conversations, we can expect further details. It's something that -- Secretary Tillerson obviously just got sworn into office, -- that there will be further follow-up on that. Yeah. Q: The President will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Abe next Friday. MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: So what's the main topic for the meeting? Will the President tell Japanese Prime Minister Abe that Japan should pay more and pick up all the expense (inaudible) in Japan? MR. SPICER: I think there's going to be a lot of both trade and national security. I think as we get closer to that meeting, I'll have further information on it. But right now, as you can imagine, there's an economic aspect to this, and then there's a national security aspect to this.  Glenn. Q: Sean, you have referenced polls a couple of times from the podium, but a poll came out today. CBS says the President has a 40 percent approval rating. We've seen the approval rating drop during the transition period. He talked about polls a great deal during the campaign. A, what do you think that says about the way the American people are looking at these actions that he's taking? And, B, what do you think it says about his pledge to unite the country on the eve of his election? MR. SPICER: I think there's also a Rasmussen poll that showed he had a 51 percent approval rating. You had an Ipsos/Reuters poll that other day that showed -- and again, I don't have it handy, but a majority of people approved -- Q: (Inaudible) those.  MR. SPICER: I understand that. And I think that as the President's policies continue to get enacted, for all the hysteria regarding his efforts to protect the country, on those seven countries where we didn't have the proper vetting in place to ensure that the American people were safe, what we did have was a very high response from the American people in support of that. His policies continue to do it. The President understands this is a marathon, and not a sprint. And as he continues to get people back to work, protect this country, I think the poll numbers will act in accord. Q: Sean, you mentioned the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Does the administration intend to keep Richard Cordray as the head of that agency? MR. SPICER: I don't have a staff announcement on the CFPB right now, but we'll see where we go. Q: You criticize the bureau broadly, but do you want to see it stay in place? MR. SPICER: I think we'll have further updates on that. That's an area that we need to work with Congress on. April. Q: Okay, Sean, two things. One, you said something about President Trump talking on the Facebook Live that he was going to talk about Black History Month and issues pertaining to the African American community. When you first came, a couple days into the administration, I asked you about the agenda, the black agenda that he had possibly formulated or he was formulating as he came out maybe the day before with the issue of Chicago, or the day after -- something around that time -- Chicago and sending the Feds in if it doesn't change. Has he now formulated a plan to deal with the black community, not just with issues of law and order? What is that -- MR. SPICER: I mean, he had a meeting with African American leaders the other day in the Roosevelt Room. I think part of this is, to your point, it isn't just law and order -- it's jobs, it's education, it's health care, small business lending. There's a lot that goes along with that agenda. And I think part of these business meetings they have are about hiring and small business and job creation. All of those issues, I think, are at the forefront of small business -- or that community. So it's not just a single thing. I think that there's a lot, whether it's crime and law and order, or education, health care, small business, job creation. That impacts that entire segment of the population, whether they're living in a rural part of the country or an inner city. And I think that's what he's really focused on right now.  Q: Sean -- Q: Wait, I'm not finished. So he's now formulating the agenda? MR. SPICER: Absolutely.  Q: Okay. So the second question -- CVE. What's on the table for that?  MR. SPICER: We're not getting -- I have nothing to announce on that right now. Q: You have nothing to announce, but people are concerned -- MR. SPICER: I understand people. I understand we've heard a lot of rumors about what may or may not. When we have something to announce on that, we will do it. But I don't think it should be any surprise that the President, when it comes to rooting out radical Islamic terrorism, which is what that initially was supposed to be focused on, he is going to make sure that that is a major focus of his -- keeping this country safe. And so I don't have anything further for you on that. I'm just -- Q: What about excluding people -- there are reports about excluding white supremacists from -- MR. SPICER: There are a reports. I don't have anything for you. I just said I don't have anything for you, but I will be very clear that this President's commitment to rooting out radical Islamic terrorism is something that is at the forefront of his agenda. And I know that there's been a lot of reports about where that program or that effort is going to lie.  Q: Is there going to be any kind of target on the issues of white supremacy? MR. SPICER: I have nothing else. Thank you, April. Cecilia. Q: Sean, thank you. The President has been using some tough talk, tough language on Iran -- ""playing with fire."" Should Americans be ready for the possibility of military action with Iran? Is that on the table? MR. SPICER: Look, I've said this before, the President has been very clear: He doesn't take options off the table but he understands the impact of something like that. The sanctions today I think are going to be very, very strong and impactful. And I hope that Iran realizes that after the provocative measures that they've taken, that they understand that this President and this administration is not going to sit back and take it lightly.  John Gizzi. Q: Thank you, Sean. On Monday, several published reports saying that it will be a tie in the Senate on the confirmation of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education, and Mike Pence will have to cast a historic tie-breaking vote as Vice President. Should we be watching for any surprises? Has the Congressional Affairs Office perhaps gotten one more vote from the ""no"" camp into the ""yes""? Or do you expect the Vice President to be on hand to confirm her? MR. SPICER: Look, I would say this: Betsy DeVos, as I mentioned before, is an unbelievable champion of education -- for children, for teachers, for parents. I hope that that vote gets 60, 70 votes. She is an unbelievable, remarkable woman who has fought very hard to improve our nation's education system and to make sure that schools are serving children. And I think that we are going to make sure we do everything we can, and we feel 100 percent confident that she will be confirmed Monday night and be the next Secretary of Education. Thank you, guys. Have a great weekend. The President is about to sign executive orders. I hope you all have a great weekend. To those of you who can't travel down to Florida, we'll be gaggling on the plane on Monday. Thank you. Have a great weekend.  END 1:07 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-02-06,"4:01 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Hi guys, how are you? Hope you had a great day. I want to start off by congratulating the five-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. It was a great day for football last night. And the President looks forward to welcoming the New England Patriots to the White House later this year. As you know, during the weekend, the President spoke to four world leaders. On Saturday, he spoke with Italian Prime Minister Gentiloni, during which they discussed strengthening cooperation around a large range of shared interests. The President also agreed to attend the G7 meeting in May, where he looks forward to meeting with the Prime Minister on the sidelines.  Also on Saturday, the President spoke with Ukrainian President Poroshenko, addressing a variety of topics, including Ukraine's long-running conflict with Russia. They also discussed plans for an in-person meeting in the future. On Sunday, the President had a call with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, where he reiterated the United States' interest in (inaudible) NATO. The two leaders agreed to continue close coordination and cooperation to discuss the full range of security issues facing NATO and its member countries.  Following that call, the President spoke with New Zealand Prime Minister English, affirming the close relationship between the two countries and our appreciation for New Zealand's significant contributions to international peace. You guys, as you saw this afternoon, the President had an opportunity to visit with leaders of both SOCOM and CENTCOM to get an update on the issues facing our military and the hotspots around the world, the challenges we face, and the actions that our brave men and women around the globe are taking to help keep this country safe. The President obviously had a chance to sit down with enlisted members of our military after that, and hear from them their concerns and issues, and, most importantly, thank them for their service to our nation. Tomorrow, we have a delegation that is heading out to attend the inauguration of the Haitian President in Port-au-Prince. The State Department's Undersecretary for Political Affairs, Tom Shannon, will lead the delegation, which includes representatives from both the State Department and the White House.  The President is also looking forward to welcoming the Prime Minister of Japan this Friday, and we'll have further guidance on that visit this weekend. With that, I'll take a few questions. Steve. Q: Can you give us an example of a terrorist attack anywhere that the news media has not reported on? MR. SPICER: We'll provide a list later. There's several instances. And the President, again, got a great update today on the fight against ISIS that's going on throughout the region and what our military is facing throughout this globe, trying to combat ISIS. But there's a lot of instances that have occurred where I don't think that they've gotten the coverage it's deserved, and I think that's what the President was clearly referring to there. Steve. Q: Are you rethinking your strategy toward this executive order? What's your next step in pushing this ahead? MR. SPICER: We're not rethinking the strategy at all. I think the court has asked both parties to present their cases. Remember, what we're discussing right now has nothing to do with the merits of the order. The law is very clear on this, that the President has huge discretion to protect the safety of the American people and our nation's institutions with respect to who can come into this country. This is just purely on the injunction that the judge issued, and I think that we're going to make that case tonight -- or he's got -- both sides have put forward their rulings. But again, when you look at the case in Massachusetts -- or the judge in Massachusetts, clearly the law is on the President's side. The Constitution is on the President's side. He has broad discretion to do what's in the nation's best interests to protect our people. And we feel very confident that we will prevail in this matter. Q: But you're not thinking about withdrawing the executive order or rewriting it? MR. SPICER: No, no, no. This law -- this executive order was done in the best interest of protecting the American people. And I think this is something that has broad support from the American people from one coast to another, and we're going to continue to do what we have to. And this President is committed to making sure that the country and its people are safe. Q: Sean, the President over the weekend said that he believed that jihadis were now pouring into the country. Is there any evidence to suggest that that's true? Is that what intelligence is telling him? MR. SPICER: I think part of the reason he issued the order the way he did was to ensure that people didn't have an advance notice, and he protected the country and ensured that we have an idea of who's coming in and out of the country.  Q: Is anybody coming in? MR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into specific information that the President has. Needless to say, again, that his number-one priority is to do what he can to keep the American people safe. Q: John Yoo, who was obviously a major figure in the Bush administration, who spoke about -- was a big proponent of executive authority, today wrote in The New York Times about his concerns about the way that the new administration is taking action. What do you say to him? MR. SPICER: Well, again, I think if you look at Secretary Kelly's comments from last week, this was an action that was fully coordinated through departments to make sure that everyone understood what we're going to do, to make sure it was compliant, and that it was in the best interest of keeping America safe. Mr. Yoo has obviously spent some time in the Justice Department, and I think he should understand better than anybody that we did -- we took all the necessary steps and did it in a way that protected country.  Q: You said -- just to be clear -- before you said that, you're going to follow up later with the unreported terrorist -- were they unreported or under-reported?  MR. SPICER: Under-reported. Q: And what are the reasons? The President said that we all know what the reasons are. MR. SPICER: Look, I think the President's comments were very clear at the time. He felt as though members of the media don't always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered; that a protest will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn't necessarily get the same coverage. He's doing what he can to protect this nation and protect our people. And that's why I think sometimes the polls don't reflect what you see on the media. You see a wide degree of support for the President's policies to protect this country, to create jobs, to grow the economy, and yet a lot of those stories and successes that he's had in a mere two and a half weeks in office aren't exactly covered to the degree to which they should be. Q: So he thinks that these terror attacks are under-reported to make him look bad? MR. SPICER: No, that's not what he said at all. I think his statement was very clear on that.  Yes. Q: Do you have a plan to reinstate extreme vetting?  MR. SPICER: What?  Q: Extreme vetting of refugees, do you have -- is there a plan to reinstate it? MR. SPICER: Reinstate it? Q: Reinstate, yes. After the ban has been overturned. MR. SPICER: Once we win the case, it will go right back into action. We're complying with the court. Once we prevail, it will go right back into action.  And again, part of that plan was a 90-day and 100-day plan respectively with respect to refugees and then people coming in to make sure that we took the steps and developed a further plan to protect the country. Whether we add people or go more stringently in other aspects is up to part of what is determined during that period. Q: Sean, can you elaborate a little bit on what the President said to Bill O'Reilly about the irregular voter registration list and what Vice President Pence is going to be doing on that? MR. SPICER: I think he's very clear that he is going to -- he has named Vice President Pence to lead a task force that will look into this. But obviously when you see so many people that have registered in two states, that that presents a problem. There are people that have registered in two have died and been still on the rolls. I think we need to look into this to make sure that we're protecting the integrity of the vote; that one person's vote should count the same as the next. And any attempt to undermine that really undermines anyone else's vote right now, and that's the problem -- is that we need to make sure that when somebody votes, that we have the highest degree of integrity of that counting. Q: Hey, Sean, when the President tweeted this morning -- ""I call my own shots"" -- was he referring to Steve Bannon's role in the White House or his TIME magazine cover? What was he referring to? MR. SPICER: It was nothing specific. But I think the President -- there's been a lot of attempts to discuss how this works. The President, from day one, back through the campaign and, frankly, his time as a successful businessman, always called the shots. He's the decider. He's the one who develops the policy. He's the one who makes the decisions. And I think that there are so many times when you see things that don't recognize that he is the guy that calls those shots. He develops the policies, he implements the policies, he makes the key decisions. Q: Just to follow up on that, The New York Times said this morning that you're rethinking your strategy of how swiftly to roll out initiatives. Are you going to slow things down? MR. SPICER: I would say that that story was so riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the President an apology for the way that that thing was -- there were just literally blatant factual errors. And it's unacceptable to see that kind of reporting, or so-called reporting. That is literally the epitome of fake news.  Q: What part of the story was the -- MR. SPICER: I mean, you start at the top -- I don't think the President owns a bathrobe, or definitely doesn't wear one. There was no meetings in conference -- I mean, it's just -- from top to bottom, it made up stories that just don't exist. And I think that's unfortunate for people that look to news institutions like that for their news because it is just not an accurate portrayal of what's really happening.  Q: Was the claim about whether he was briefed on the order -- the makeup of the NSC? MR. SPICER: What's that? Q: The story talked about how the President was disappointed that he hadn't been adequately briefed on Bannon taking --  MR. SPICER: The President is briefed on all aspects of -- Q: So could you just address that specifically? What was he told and who briefed him on it? MR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into detail, but I would say that the President is clearly aware of the policies that come out of the White House with his name on it. That is what I was getting at earlier to Steve. The President -- when it comes to decisions and policy, it's the President who leads, the President who tells us how to implement it. Thank you guys very much. Enjoy the landing. END 4:10 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-02-07,"1:42 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Good afternoon. Just before I came up, I wanted to let you all know that we're monitoring the severe weather that's going through Louisiana at this time. The President is aware of the situation and is going to be reaching out to local and state officials throughout the day. Also, yesterday evening, the President concurred with the FEMA Administrator's recommendation to approve Governor Bryant's request to add public assistance to the previously issued major disaster declaration in Mississippi. Per the Governor's request, public assistance will be added for three counties -- Forrest, Lamar, and Perry.  Yesterday, the President had an amazing day at MacDill Air Force Base, where he met with leaders of both Special Operations Command and Central Command, and then had lunch with enlisted servicemembers thanking them for their service and hearing the ideas that were on their mind. The President announced his intent to make historic financial investment in the armed forces of the United States, showing the entire world that America has the back of all those who stand in defense of freedom. As he has said many times before, the armed forces are at the very center of our fight against radical Islamic terrorism, and we must protect those who protect us. The President kicked off today with a listening session of county sheriffs from around the country. The President welcomed leaders from the National Sheriffs' Association to the White House and pledged to work closely with all members of the law enforcement community to keep the American people safe. He assured the sheriffs that the Trump administration will make every effort to stop drugs and crime from flowing into the country, put an end to the opioid epidemic, secure the borders to keep terrorists out, and strengthen the bonds between state, local and federal law enforcement agencies.  The sheriffs thanked the President for what they described as his ""unprecedented"" level of support for law enforcement and offered their full backing of his border security and immigration policies. They expressed how encouraged they have been by the pro-law enforcement atmosphere that has swept the country in the wake of the President's victory.  They also presented a letter on behalf of the National Sheriffs' Association, thanking the President for his ""recent show of support for law enforcement, specifically on immigration and border security issues"" and commending the President's two executive orders for taking ""significant steps to enhancing public safety."" The group engaged in a wide-ranging discussion about the issues facing the law enforcement community, which the sheriffs said was an opportunity they hadn't been given under the previous administration. The sheriffs closed the meeting by thanking the President for defending the rule of law. And the President took them to the Oval Office to honor them and show his appreciation for their outstanding work they do to keep our communities safe. A list of the attendees is available for those who are interested.  After that meeting, the President held another listening session on how to best fix the VA. It's a top priority for the President and this administration to ensure that veterans get the care they need when and where they need it. Tragically, many of our veterans are being failed by a system that does not work. This administration will reform and modernize the VA under the leadership of Dr. Shulkin, creating a culture of accountability that puts our veterans first. The President welcomed the group to the Roosevelt Room and expressed his intention to take whatever steps are necessary to improve health care access and quality for our heroic veterans. Ms. Tiffany Smiley, the wife of a veteran who was blinded by an IED, detailed her family's difficulty and experience with the VA health care system, and offered suggestions to how it could be improved. The President, VA Secretary-designate Dr. David Shulkin, and a group of health care experts and veterans advocates, including Ike & Laura Perlmutter, engaged in a wide-ranging discussion on reforming the VA so that the needs of veterans come first.  The experts discussed private sector solutions and innovations that could be used to improve the VA. The President praised the Secretary-designate for his commitment to veterans and thanked the group for their willingness to serve and do what was best for our veterans. They plan to meet on a regular basis to discuss their collective efforts to improve the VA and its health care system.  Also this afternoon, the Vice President had a big day on Capitol Hill, where he cast a historic deciding vote for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. The President believes strongly that our nation's success depends on the education of our students. And Betsy DeVos has devoted nearly three decades of her time and talent to promoting educational opportunity. As Secretary, she will ensure that every student has access to a good school, whether it's public, private, parochial, charter, or any other kind. The fact that we had to get to the point where the Vice President had to be pulled in to overcome the Democrats' historic and partisan logjam of the President's qualified nominee is another glaring reminder of the unprecedented obstruction that Senate Democrats have engaged in throughout this process. The American people sent a strong message when they elected President Trump in November: They're fed up with business as usual in Washington. Democrats in the Senate should expect that voters will remember how they stood in the way of the President enacting an agenda that put him into office.  Last week, I noted the President had a fair amount of Cabinet-level appointees awaiting a full vote by the Senate. We're looking forward to seeing more of the President's picks to lead agencies and departments confirmed in the upcoming week, despite these childish tactics of the Democrats in the Senate, who would rather keep the failed status quo than allowing to put the President's people in place. Also on the Hill today, Judge Gorsuch continues a full week of meetings with Republican and Democratic senators. Yesterday, he met with Senators Tester and Feinstein. Today he will meet with Senators Sasse, Schumer, Crapo, and Thune. The President is looking forward to a full hearing for the judge, followed by an up or down vote on this incredibly qualified nominee. At this moment, the President is meeting with Congressman Jason Chaffetz to discuss how to work together to enact his reform agenda. Later this afternoon, the President will meet with Secretary of State Tillerson. The President was obviously pleased to welcome and confirm -- swear in Secretary Tillerson in the Oval Office last week, and he's pleased that the Secretary is now able to bring his unique skillset and deep insights to the important work of the State Department. Following his discussion with Secretary Tillerson, the President will have calls with Prime Minister Rajoy of Spain and President Erdogan of Turkey. We'll of course have readouts of both of those calls when they're completed. This evening, the President will host young officers from the United States Army Special Forces Qualification Course in the Oval Office. As the President said yesterday, members of our military and their families are our nation's heroes. It is one of his top priorities to ensure that the men and women of our armed forces have the tools, equipment, and resources they need to execute their mission successfully. The President is looking forward to conveying his gratitude and support to these young brave captains. Later this evening, around 6:00, 9th Circuit Court will hold oral arguments, per its order from yesterday. I want to quickly run down what we can expect to happen tonight. A career attorney from the Department of Justice will present an argument in defense of the President's order. And to be clear, all that's at issue tonight is the hearing -- is an interim decision on whether the President's order is enforced or not until the case is heard on the actual merits of the order. It's a simple status quo versus anti-status quo decision. This is just like the case in Boston, which started as a temporary restraining order. There, once we were able to explain our position, the court lifted the order and held that the President's executive order could take effect. As I have stated before, 8 U.S. Code 1182 gives the President constitutional authority for this executive order. It says, ""Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions which he may deem to be appropriate."" We look forward to a final decision on the merits of this soon. Looking ahead, I know a few have been asking for more details on Prime Minister Abe's visit later this week. As previously announced, he will visit the White House for meetings on the 10th of February. The President has also invited him down to Mar-a-Lago, and the two leaders will travel there for the weekend. This is a testament to the importance the United States places on the bilateral relationship and the strength of our alliance, and the deep economic ties between the United States and Japan. Needless to say, the President is looking very much forward to welcoming the New England Patriots to the White House to celebrate their fifth World Championship. It was obviously a spectacular game. Lastly, we have our eyes on Kabul today following the tragic suicide bombing that killed at least 19 Afghan civilians and wounded 14 [41]. Just this morning, General Flynn spoke with the Afghan National Security Advisor to reaffirm our continued support for Afghanistan and for our Strategic Partnership. We condemn this cowardly attack in the strongest possible terms, and we commend the Afghan security forces for their rapid response. We also reaffirm our support to the Afghan government as they work to defend their people against enemies of peace. And with that, I'll take your questions. David Jackson. Q: Sean, the list of 78 terrorist attacks that you released, it looked like it had been prepared well in advance. I mean, was that already on hand when President Trump made his comments? Or did you do it afterwards and plan to release it? MR. SPICER: Well, I think the answer was, we had been getting questions as to what the President's remarks were. We wanted to be very clear that there are a lot of examples between 2014 and 2016 that have occurred, and many of them haven't gotten the attention that they have deserved. It's becoming too often that we're seeing these attacks not get the spectacular attention that they deserve. And I think it undermines the understanding of the threat that we face around this country. The reason the President has been acting in so many of the ways that he has with executive order and otherwise, the discussions that he had down at CENTCOM and SOCOM yesterday, are because he cares about making sure that we don't have attacks in this country, that we're protected, that we're ahead of the curve. And I think what we need to do is to remind people that the Earth is a very dangerous place these days, that ISIS is trying to do us harm, and that the President's commitment is to keep this country safe. And I think part of this is to make sure that the American people are reminded how prevalent some of these attacks and how much time and attention they have or have not gotten, but, more importantly, to make sure that they understand the unwavering commitment that the President has and the actions that he will take to keep the country safe. Q: Was the list put together after his comments?  MR. SPICER: Yes. Yes.  Trey. Q: Thanks, Sean. On the call with Turkish President Erdogan later today, does President Trump intend to discuss plans for Syrian safe zones? And does the President expect Turkey to help create those zones? MR. SPICER: I think we'll have a readout for you on that. I don't want to get ahead of the two leaders' calls.  Alexis, RealClearPolitics. Q: Sean, I have two questions for you. You were mentioning that voters are going to remember how senators voted on the President's Cabinet nominees. Two Republicans voted against Betsy DeVos -- Senators Collins and Murkowski. Did the President reach out to either of them? And will he not forget what Republicans did in that particular nominee situation? MR. SPICER: I think -- look, the President has been very clear it's not Republicans that have stood in the way of this nomination of all of these qualified individuals. It's been Democrats that have stalled over and over again, not attending hearings, trying to use every delay tactic possible. It's those people that have a problem, and I think that's the message that the party has missed on the Democratic side, which -- and I don't think that -- I wouldn't paint it with a broad brush, because I think it's Senate Democrats, frankly, that haven't gotten the message. Q: But he never reached out to them? MR. SPICER: Our team has been in contact with the entire Senate team to make sure that they understand and that they've had visits as requested. But we have been in constant contact with the Senate, members of the Senate, their staffs. Our legislative affairs team has had an extremely robust schedule of meetings with their teams to make these nominees available to them. But I think the broader issue, again -- and with all due respect, I think it's interesting that we're focusing on the votes of two Republicans when you look at the spectrum of antics that have gone on in the Democrats. I mean, the tactics that they have done over and over and over again to delay, not show up to hearings, filibuster to the extent that they can, run the clock out -- it's not Republicans that have a problem here, Alexis. It's the Democrats that continue to do this. Q: The second question has to do with the President's remarks about the Affordable Care Act in his interview on Sunday -- because he indicated in his response, in that interview, that he thought that the repeal-and-replace was going to take longer, perhaps into 2018. Can you clarify whether he is frustrated about this, what he is doing about the timing? Because, of course, voters who sent him here were anticipating that this might move faster than he was conveying in the interview. MR. SPICER: Well, I think luckily -- and you saw Speaker Ryan's comments earlier today -- I think we can have this done legislatively sooner rather than later, but I think the implementation of a lot of the pieces may take a little bit longer. It's a big, big bill that the Democrats passed. As you recall, they told us we could read it after they passed it. We are now going through this to make sure that we do this in a very responsible way, to make sure that health care, which is so vital to so many Americans and their families, is preserved while we put a new system in place that both lowers costs and increases accessibility. But the President, I think, is very encouraged by the commitment and work that's going on on the Hill to make sure that we get this thing replaced as quick as possible. Fred Lucas. Q: Thanks, Sean. I wanted to ask -- actually, a follow-up related to that. Speaker Ryan has actually said -- and I'm quoting -- with Obamacare you can't ""tinker at the margins and repair it. You can't. It is a collapsing law."" Do you agree with that? And you can't build on what's already there, you have to get rid of the entire law? MR. SPICER: I think what we're focused on is the end solution. And I think we've been very clear over and over again that the President is going to repeal and replace it, and that what Americans will get at the end of this is a health care solution that, as I've said before over and over again, is going to give them a lower-cost health solution with more options. That's what they were promised in the first place. That's what we can give. And I think the President, being able to approach this in the businesslike manner that he's done so successfully in the past, is going to ensure that he negotiates prices, that we look at those business-like practices, force competition among states and other things that will help lower cost once and for all, and provide that competition.  Q: On Iran sanctions, does the President have any concerns about the fact that Adam Szubin is the Acting Treasury Secretary in terms of implementing those sanctions? MR. SPICER: No. We implemented them -- they went off without a hitch. Fred -- I mean, John Decker. Q: Thanks a lot, Sean. As you know, the President spoke over the weekend on Twitter and criticized the federal judge appointed by George W. Bush who imposed the nationwide restraining order. He called him a ""so-called judge."" Is the President, as it relates to the arguments -- I know you're confident -- but the arguments that will be presented this evening -- is he prepared to accept an adverse ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals? MR. SPICER: There's no question the President respects the judicial branch and its ruling, but I think that there's no way -- I just read off the U.S. code on that. I don't think there's any other way that you can interpret that, that the President has the discretion to do what's necessary to keep this country safe. And I think that's his concern, frankly, right now, is that when the law is such as it is, that anyone could interpret that any other way. I think he feels confident, just like in the ruling in Boston, that we're going to prevail on this on the merits of the case because it is done so in a very lawful way. Katherine. Q: Will the administration take a position on the Israeli legislation to retract or illegalize the thousands of West Bank settlements? Last week, obviously, you said building the settlements may not be helpful.  MR. SPICER: I think that, as I mentioned last week -- and I don't want to get too far ahead of this -- but Prime Minister Netanyahu will be here on the 15th. I think that will be obviously a topic of discussion right now. I don't want to get ahead of that. Charlie Spiering. Q: Thanks, Sean. Just a quick question. Any response to the calls for impeachment by Representative Maxine Waters? MR. SPICER: No. Hunter Walker. I mean, I would just say, look, I think, look, it is -- the President is doing everything he can to move this country forward. And I think whether it's the Democrats in the Senate who are trying to stall these nominees or these little political stunts on the House side, the bottom line is, I think by and large you see the support that the President is receiving for his policies throughout the country. And it's because I think people recognize, A, that business as usual is over and that the President's commitment to both keeping this country safe, growing the economy and creating jobs is something that is welcomed by all Americans, regardless of party. I think when you see stuff like that, I think it really just shows that they really missed the message that voters sent this past November. Hunter Walker. Q: Thank you, Sean. CNN reportedly declined to interview Kellyanne Conway on Sunday because of the questions about her credibility. Is the White House willing to offer alternative representatives to networks that refuse to work with specific spokespeople? MR. SPICER: Well, frankly, I think that my understanding is they retracted that, they walked that back or denied it, however you want to put it -- I don't care. But I think Kellyanne is a very trusted aide of the President. I think for any characterization otherwise is insulting. I don't think -- if they choose not to work with someone, that's up to them. But I think we're going to continue to put out key leaders of this administration, including Kellyanne, that can articulate the President's policies and agenda. Katie Pavlich. Q: Thanks, Sean, for the question. Is President Trump planning to ask the Senate to expedite legislation allowing for the swift firing of bad VA employees? MR. SPICER: I think the President's commitment, as you heard both during the campaign and as he's talked to Dr. Shulkin, is to make sure that we're providing the best care. And if there's things that are an impediment to that care being offered up or reformed, then he is going to make sure that we enact policies internally that make sure that people who are not doing their job, not servicing veterans, we can figure out how to expedite that process.  But the idea that we're sitting around having a discussion about personnel inhibiting the care that veterans deserve really does not bode well for the reflection that we want on this country. I mean, people who have served this nation -- we should be bending over backwards to make sure that the benefits and the care and the services that they, frankly, earned is something that is given the highest priority and is something that the President remains highly committed to. Miriam Borgess. Q: Hey, hi. The President is going to speak later today with the Spanish leader, Mariano Rajoy. And I would like to know how President Trump sees the relation with Spain, and which are the main issues they are going to discuss in their phone call. MR. SPICER: So I'm not going to -- we'll have a readout after the call, but I imagine that they're going to talk about a shared commitment to defeating ISIS and that they'll discuss our bilateral relationship and reaffirm our commitment to the two countries. I think we will have a readout on that call with Spain as we will with all the countries and all the other leaders that we will talk to and we have in the past. So I don't want to get too far ahead of it, but I would imagine that the current relationship that we have with Spain and our commitment to ISIS will be at the forefront of that. Maria Pe—Åa. Q: Yes, here, sorry. Thank you. It's kind of loud in here. So it's a two-part question. One, can you confirm whether or not the White House has accepted the credentials of the new Mexican ambassador, Ger—Énimo Guti–πrrez? And also Representative Mike Rogers, I believe, this morning said that he plans to introduce a bill to impose a 2 percent tax on all remittances that Mexicans send to their country to pay for the wall. Would the President rally behind that bill? MR. SPICER: So, first, I would have to get back to you on the ambassador's credentials. I don't know. We could check with the Department of State and figure that out. I don't know that right off the top of my head.  And I'm not going to comment -- I don't -- we don't put out statements of administration policy until the bill has gone through the process. Hallie. Q: Two questions for you. One, following up on health care, the President, as you know, campaigned for 18 months on replacing the Affordable Care Act. Where is his plan? MR. SPICER: He's working with Congress. I just answered that question. But he's working with Speaker Ryan. Let me -- you're acting like --  Q: The specifics of it, though. I mean, does he owe the American people something now given --  MR. SPICER: And I think he's been very clear that he owes the American people a result that's going to lower costs and provide more access. That's what he continues to work with Speaker Ryan on. I think the Speaker was very clear on it -- that they're having meetings both legislatively and at the principal level to make sure that this gets done. And I think as you heard Speaker Ryan, we continue to be optimistic about getting this thing completed by this year. It's a mammoth bill what they passed and did it -- and I think we've got to make sure that we do this right. We don't want to end up with the same result that Democrats did. They rushed it through. No one was able to read the bill. And premiums have skyrocketed; access and options have gone down. We need to make sure that we don't do this in a way that's going to end up with the same result. John Roberts. Q: I have a question for you, Sean, though, on Yemen.  MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: I did say two. Q: One of the world's most wanted terrorists is now taunting President Trump, calling him a ""fool"" after that raid. MR. SPICER: Right.  Q: Any response from the White House? And do you still stand by your characterization that it was a successful raid? MR. SPICER: Absolutely. That -- he was not -- that was -- the raid that was conducted in Yemen was an intelligence-gathering raid. That's what it was. It was highly successful. It achieved the purpose it was going to get -- save the loss of life that we suffered and the injuries that occurred. The goal -- Q: So you're pushing back on reporting that he was a target? MR. SPICER: Absolutely. He was not -- the goal of the raid was intelligence-gathering. And that's what we received, and that's what we got. That's why we can deem it a success. John Roberts. Q: If -- and I know that you believe that you have a good case on the merits to lift the temporary restraining order. If the President does not prevail at the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, will he take this to the Supreme Court?  MR. SPICER: Let's see where we go. I think he made it very clear that -- Q: Can I just finish?  MR. SPICER: Yes, you can. I'm sorry. Q: And is he concerned that if this does go to the Supreme Court with its current 4-4 makeup, that this temporary restraining order might become a little more permanent?  MR. SPICER: Well, remember tonight is about just a restraining order. We're not --  Q: I know what it's about. That's not the question.  MR. SPICER: Right, I understand. But I think that it's important to explain this to everyone, John, because I know you get it and so many others -- but I just want to make sure. Tonight is about the restraining order. It has nothing to do with the merits of the case. And that's why I think we feel confident. The question is: Does the restraining order get lifted or not? But regardless of what happens tonight, the merits of the case still need to be -- to discuss.  And I think the merits of the case, as they were in Boston, are ones that we feel very confident on because the law is crystal clear on this. The President has the authority to do this. It was done so in an interagency process that ensured that all the appropriate people were consulted. We went through that with flying colors. I have zero concern that at the end of the day, we'll be fine. It's just a question of going through the process. Q: And I get all that, as you pointed it out. But if he does not prevail at the 9th Circuit, will he take this case to the Supreme Court?  MR. SPICER: I'm not going to get -- let's see where it goes first. I think our goal right now is to get to a point we can argue it on the merits. We feel confident, based on how the Court has reacted in Massachusetts, that we're going to be good on the merits. Jonathan Swan. Q: Thanks for the question. Does President Trump still plan to immediately terminate President Obama's executive amnesties? MR. SPICER: With respect to what, DACA and DAPA? Q: DAPA. MR. SPICER: I've said this before, we'll have further updates on that. Go ahead. Q: But just in the thing, it said ""immediately terminate.""  MR. SPICER: I understand that.  Q: So I just wondered what the delay is. MR. SPICER: And I've made it -- and I've said before the President will have further updates on both DACA and DAPA very shortly. We've been very clear on immigration -- what the President's priorities would be. As you heard Secretary Kelly testify in front of Congress today, there is going to be continued progress on the wall and on immigration as a whole. So we're going to have plenty of time to address this.  Right now, he's trying to do it in a very systematic way in accordance to where we find the biggest problems. And so he's been very clear in the past that those who are in this country that pose a threat to us or with a criminal record are where his priorities are going to be first and foremost, and we're going to move through the rest of folks that are in this country illegally. Sarah. Q: Thank you, Sean. Back to Iran. The Ayatollah Khamenei said today that Trump has ""helped Iran reveal the true face of America."" He said Iran doesn't fear Trump, and he encouraged Iranians to march in the street against America later this week. Does the President have a response to those very aggressive comments? And does he plan to take additional action against Iran if its leaders continue to escalate tensions? MR. SPICER: I think the President -- or the Ayatollah is going to realize that there is a new President in office. This President is not going to sit by and let Iran flout its violations, or its apparent violations to the joint agreement. But he will continue to take action as he sees fit. The President has also made clear time and time again that he's not going to project what those actions will be, and he will not take anything off the table. But I think Iran is kidding itself if they don't realize that there is a new President in town. John Gizzi. Q: Thank you, Sean. On Thursday, weather permitting, the President is going to meet with airline executives from throughout the country. Two complaints from airline executives, as well as the Pilots Association, have been, one, that Norwegian Airlines got a special advantage, a foreign carrier permit from the Obama administration, and also that the airlines of the Arab Emirates are state-subsidized, and both cases are violations of the Blue Skies Act between the U.S. and the EU. Is this something he's going to address? And is he considering upending President Obama's foreign carrier permit? MR. SPICER: Well, again, that will be something that -- that will be decided when they meet, what they'll talk about. Obviously, the President is going to want to talk about economic growth and job creation, how he's enacting orders to make sure the country is safe. On the case of Norwegian, my understanding, if I'm correct, that there is a deal in which they're having 50 percent of the crews and the pilots are American-based. They're flying Boeing planes. There is a huge economic interest that America has in that deal right now. I don't want to get ahead of the President on that. But just to be clear, I mean, when you're talking about U.S. jobs, both in terms of the people who are serving those planes and the person who's building those planes. That's a very big difference. Zeke. Q: Thanks, Sean. A few minutes ago you said that the President wanted to remind the American people of how prevalent terrorist attacks are and that the Earth is a dangerous place. That kind of breaks with the rhetoric we've seen bipartisan administrations use when it comes to terrorist attacks, encouraging the American people to go about their daily lives.  MR. SPICER: That's not the point that -- no, no, no, --  Q: Does this President have a different message to the American people? MR. SPICER: I think, yeah, his message to the American people is that he is fully committed to doing everything that he can to keep the country safe. And I think that there's a big difference between what you're saying and the point that he was making yesterday. And I think that what he's getting at is making -- he was making a point as to the exposure that attacks get. And I think that's what he was getting at, is that we see these things and they're becoming too prevalent.  And that's why I think he wants to become ever vigilant to make sure that we don't ever get lax, that we need to be reminded that places and groups like ISIS continue to seek to do us harm, and that it is his job as Commander-in-Chief to do everything he can to get ahead of the curve and keep this country safe. I think when you look at the poll that came out last week -- and I think it was 67 percent of the American people agree with his proposition to put further restrictions on people, to make sure that we have countries who are sending people to our country that they are coming here for peaceful purposes, and that if we can't guarantee those countries have the proper vetting and systems in place when they are outbound to the United States, then we need to do what we can, and he will do what he has to as President, to make sure that this country is safe. So I think there is a -- the point that he was making was not to put fear in anybody, but to, rather, reassure them that as President of the United States he is taking every single step to do what he has to to get ahead of the threats, to get ahead of the concerns so we're not looking in the rearview mirror thinking, what should we have done, what could we have done; that we're preventing lives -- whether it's the raid in Yemen, the law that he's enacting -- that he's going to do what he can to make sure that this homeland and our people are protected and safe. Mara. Q: Thank you. I just have two questions. One on a tweet and one on health care. When the President tweeted, ""If something happens, blame the judge and the court system,"" did he mean if a terrorist attack is committed by somebody from these seven countries? Or any terrorist attack should be blamed on the judge and the court system? MR. SPICER: Well, I think the point that he -- the tweet is pretty clear. But I think his point is, is that -- kind of dovetails what I was just saying to Zeke -- he's doing everything he can. And he walks into office -- there are seven countries that the Obama administration has already identified as not having the proper systems in place to guarantee our safety -- and I think his immediate reaction is to do what he has to do to make sure that we're not looking back and saying, you know what we should have done, we should have made sure that we had stricter vetting in place for those seven countries. So he took immediate and decisive action to make sure that this country and our people were protected. That's what he's talking about, is making sure that we don't have regret, that a month from now or two months from now or a year from now we hadn't done something to protect people. And so he acted as quick and decisively as possible to make sure that we put the systems in place to protect our people. And I don't think there's any other way to read that. Q: A question on health care. Can I just get my second question? MR. SPICER: Of course. Q: You just said he'll negotiate prices, and that's something he -- he ran on negotiating prices for Medicare, drug prices. And I just want you to clarify where he is on that, because when he met with big pharma the other day, before the meeting he said, we have no choice, we have to get prices down. After the meeting he said he would oppose anything that makes it harder for these companies to bring their drugs to market, including price fixing by Medicare. So is he for Medicare negotiating drug prices, or not? MR. SPICER: He's for it, yes. He wants to make sure --  Q: He's still for it. MR. SPICER: Absolutely. Q: Okay. MR. SPICER: The President is clear -- I mean, when you look at the costs of -- not just drug costs. The U.S. government has not done -- I mean, you look at what -- frankly, the easier way to look at this is what other countries have done -- negotiating costs to keep those down. As drug prices continue to escalate, that drives up health care costs for every American. But particularly, there's a huge burden on America's seniors who are so much more reliant on drug prices. And in many cases you have people living on a fix income. And health care costs -- rising health care costs and prescription drugs continue to be a burden on their ability to live out their lives in a much more enjoyable manner. And so his commitment is to make sure that he does what he can, and I think rather successfully uses his skills as a businessman to drive them down. Margaret. Q: Sean, can you clarify two things?  MR. SPICER: Sure. Q: One, Secretary Kerry -- Kelly, excuse me, when he was on the Hill today said that the administration right now is not looking at adding other countries to this temporary travel ban list. Is the White House still giving itself room to add some countries to that list? MR. SPICER: Well, I think what his point was is, is that right now, he's not doing it. You have to look at his testimony in context. I think he went through the fact that we're still in this review process, that he is committed to making sure that we look at all other countries. But as of this moment, there is no immediate desire to add to that, but he is looking at all of the other countries, the procedures that we have with them, the systems we have in place to check them. And so nothing is final until the end of the review period.  Q: But I had a second question, sorry. So you said still leaving room to do that. Something that the President continues to say as a phrase -- and I'm hoping you can define it for us -- is that this is about testing who truly loves America and making sure that those who enter the country are those who truly love America. How do you quantify that? What is the President thinking of? Is that a specific test? What does that mean? MR. SPICER: No, I mean -- look, I think there's a -- I think the President's goal is to make sure that people aren't coming here to do us harm; that they're going through the proper extreme vetting in cases where we don't have the information required to make a good judgment on them based on what their country is willing to provide; that we are taking the proper and necessary steps to protect our people. But he doesn't -- if someone is coming here to do us harm or to espouse things that would give us a good indication that they're not coming here for the right reasons, then we need to do everything we can to, A, vet them and, B, unless we're 100 percent certain, keep them out of the country. Q: It's a background check. MR. SPICER: It's a background check. But again, I wouldn't just -- it's not. I mean, it is -- to the extent that we can, it's going to be extreme vetting is what he's talked about; that it's not going to be just letting someone in on a quick check. If there's any cause for concern, he wants to go to every step possible to make sure that people who are entering this country are doing so because they want to come here for the right reasons and for peaceful reasons. Yeah. Q: Thank you, Sean. On South Korea, South Korea knows about Trump is very good friend of theirs. And the (inaudible) most important part of his policy on South Korea?  MR. SPICER: What will what, please? Q: What was most important part of Trump's policy towards South Korea?  Q: The most important part of the policy --  MR. SPICER: Thank you. Look, he had a conversation the other day and we look forward to filling that conversation. I think obviously the threat of North Korea is the most prominent issue that faces South Korea in our alliance right now. He wants to reassure the South Korean government, the Blue House, that we are going to do what we can to make sure that we stand with South Korea and that we prevent any further hostile actions from North Korea. So I think that the safety of our country, of South Korea, of the region are going to be clearly the greatest focus of this. Q: John-Christopher, Talk-Media News. When the President submits his budget, is he committed to pushing Congress to approve sufficient funding for all American students to have either an outstanding public school education or the public funding for them to reach an outstanding private school education? MR. SPICER: Look, I think the President has talked extensively about education during the primary, whether it's an Associate's Degree, a Bachelor's Degree, a PhD or vo-technical education that we've got to give students these days the options they need for the workforce; that a vo-tech education in some cases is what's in the interest of students in terms of their success, and giving them the skills to work on cars or become a computer engineer or whatever.  But as we head into -- as we look towards the future, we've got to make sure that we're preparing our students to have the skillset that they need. And it's also the retraining aspect of that -- that as people get older and certain industries start to turn the corner because of technology, that we're allowing people the opportunity for retraining to give them the skillset that they need to reenter the workforce and continue to be productive. So I think as you will see -- look, we literally will swear in the Secretary of Education hopefully later this evening, which we will let you all know -- probably around the 5:00 or 6:00 hour. But that will be something that he's going to continue to have a conversation with Secretary DeVos about. Something that she's made clear -- and it's unfortunate that we haven't been able to have this conversation sooner because it was held up for so long -- but I think that's something that Secretary DeVos will be speaking a lot about, about the education funding and skillset and opportunities that we give not just our children but people older in life who are looking to get back into the workforce through another avenue. Q: How about the K-12? How about the youngsters? MR. SPICER: I think we'll have plenty of time to discuss the President's budget as we get closer -- as he sort of develops that. Today, we're excited that Secretary DeVos will get sworn in.  Thanks a lot, guys. Have a great one. Take care. END 2:19 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-02-08,"1:48 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everyone. Just a few minutes ago, as many of you had seen, we had another example of the real-world results that the Trump administration is getting in its pro-jobs agenda. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced that his company is opening a high-tech manufacturing facility in Arizona that will create roughly 10,000 jobs between the factory itself and its supply chain, which is the latest wave in economic optimism that's sweeping the country following the President's victory. In his inaugural address, the President laid out an ambitious vision to create 25 million jobs over the next decade. From the beginning of his campaign, bringing jobs back to our struggling community has been one of the parts of the President's message that most resonated with the American people. Having hired tens of thousands of people himself, the President is keenly aware of what prevents businesses from being successful and creating jobs in the current economy. President Obama, by contrast, visited the same factory site where this factory will be built during his last reelection visit in 2012, touting the government incentives that were supposed to bring back jobs that had been lost to Asia. President Trump knows that for business, the real government incentive is the government restraining itself. For too many years, Washington has smothered industry in this country and under burdensome regulation. This administration will set out to free businesses from constraints of government bureaucracy and regulation.  Under the President's ""Buy American, Hire American"" agenda, the government is going to get out of the way of businesses to allow them to thrive. Just last week, the President signed what we've been calling the ""one in, two out"" executive order requiring that every new federal regulation that's adopted, two be eliminated. This new rule will provide much-needed relief for businesses who have been regulated and saddled with an absolutely staggering amount of additional red tape, as much as $1.9 trillion per year by some estimates.  In 2014, the National Association of Manufacturers calculated that companies in every industry paid an average of $9,991 per employee to comply with federal regulations. And it's only gotten worse since that study was conducted. By relieving even a small portion of this burden, we will allow businesses to grow and hire more people. Projects that have been stalled or scuttled are being revived in anticipation of the President's pro-growth policies. Last quarter, confidence among CEOs of U.S.-based companies jumped by 4.2 percent points in the YPO Global Pulse Survey, one of the single-largest quarter gains in history. This is only the beginning of the President's agenda. Moving on to recap the President's afternoon and evening yesterday, as you saw, we officially announced the 24 people who will be serving in the President's -- in his Cabinet, on the White House website yesterday. The President looks forward to having all these distinguished qualified men and women in place as heads of departments and agencies so that our government can start fully working for the American people and enacting the agenda that he brought forward during the last campaign. The President spoke with two foreign leaders yesterday. During his call with President Rajoy of Spain, the two leaders discussed our shared priorities, including efforts to eliminate ISIS. The President additionally reiterated the United States' commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and emphasized the importance of NATO allies and sharing the burden of defense spending. President Trump also spoke with President Erdogan of Turkey, during which he conveyed U.S. support to Turkey as a strategic partner and NATO ally, and welcomed Turkey's contributions to the fight against ISIS.  Last night, the President had an incredibly meaningful visit with current officers who enrolled in the Green Beret's Qualifications Course. These young men and women will be at the tip of the spear serving our country in some of the world's most dangerous places as intelligence officers. The President told these brave young soldiers how proud he was of their commitment, to risk everything to keep us safe, and how humbled he was to serve as their Commander-in-Chief, and that they could always count on him to have their back. Also, yesterday, the Department of Justice presented its arguments before the 9th Circuit Court in the case concerning the temporary restraining order on the President's national security executive order. Again, as I did yesterday, I want to emphasize that the issue before the 9th Circuit right now is extremely narrow. The question is simply whether or not the President's executive order, which we maintain is fully lawful under the Constitution and U.S. code, should remain in effect while the courts actually consider it on its merits. We expect the court to issue a decision on this matter soon, and we will have a statement once that's done. Today, the President spoke before the Major Cities police chiefs and the Major County Sheriffs Winter Conference. In his remarks, the President reiterated his commitment to a great national partnership between his administration and law enforcement. While there are many things that the federal government can do to improve safety in our communities, it truly rests with the police officers, sheriffs and deputies who risk their lives every day on our streets. And their mission is critical to the future of this country. These brave men and women have a true friend in the White House. And as the President said many times, we must protect those who protect us. He will continue to do that throughout his administration.  Later this afternoon, the President will participate in a standing legislative strategy meeting of his team here. The team has been working around the clock to engage lawmakers and get the President's agenda moving through Congress.  Yesterday, the Vice President attended the Republican Policy lunch where he discussed how the administration will work with the Senate to deliver results for the American people.  Of course, the Vice President also cast a historic vote for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos on the floor of the Senate, and then later swore her in in his office across the street.  The larger intergovernmental affairs team is maintaining direct communications to state, local and tribal leaders so that we know what issues are affecting local communities. So far, they've contacted all GOP state speakers of the house, state senate presidents, and attorneys general, and all but eight GOP state Senate majority leaders.  Our legislative team is also obviously engaged in Judge Gorsuch's nomination. He had another full day of meetings in the Senate with both Republicans and Democrats. He met this morning with Senators Flake and Heitkamp. And this afternoon he'll meet with Senators Cotton, Blumenthal, McCaskill and Heller. We're also pleased to see another Democrat, Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, come out and say that the eminently qualified Judge Gorsuch deserves an up or down vote. That brings up now to nine total Democrats who have come out and expressed a willingness to treat Judge Gorsuch fairly. We hope more Democrats will continue to join their colleagues in fulfilling their constitutional duty to offer advice and consent on the President's nominee. Also, on the Hill, we expect Attorney General-designate Sessions to receive a full vote on the floor of the Senate tonight. As unfortunately has become commonplace in the Senate, Democrats once again spent hours last night in a counterproductive discussion about one of President's clearly qualified nominees, not to mention one of their peers. Senator Sessions has a long and distinguished legal career, serving as both the U.S. attorney of the southern district of Alabama, and also as Alabama's attorney general.  The President looks forward to Senator Sessions's return to the Department of Justice where he will continue his service to our nation as our chief law enforcement officer. We also anticipate votes later this week on Secretary-designate Price and Mnuchin. Finally, before I open it up for questions, the White House has spoken with the governor of Louisiana about the severe where in the Gulf Coast. We've also made contact with the mayors of the affected areas. FEMA is monitoring the situation around the clock and is in the process of deploying teams to support response and recovery activities. At this time, there have been no additional requests for federal assistance, and we'll update you should that change. With that, let me go to the first question from Courtis Fuller from WLWT NBC in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Q: Good afternoon. Cincinnati, among other cities, has recently voted to become a sanctuary city. City leaders here are vowing not to enforce federal immigration laws without a specific request. They also say they want to be open and welcoming to refugees. My question today: How will President Trump respond? Will Cincinnati face economic or other sanctions, including, for example, funding of the Brent Spence Bridge, which he said he would fund when he was on the campaign trail? MR. SPICER: Thanks, Courtis. As I've noted before, at the end of the day, this order is about two things: one, keeping our cities safe, and two, respecting the hard-earned taxpayers who send their money to the federal government. And the President is going to do everything he can within the scope of the executive order to make sure that cities who don't comply with it -- counties and other institutions that remain sanctuary cities don't get federal government funding in compliance with the executive order. I think more areas like Miami-Dade, down in Florida, understand the importance of this order, and we hope cities like Cincinnati and other communities around the country follow their lead and comply with that. With that, Anita Kumar. Q: I have two questions. The first one is, can you tell us who is paying or how this is happening with Prime Minister Abe's visit to Mar-a-Lago? Who will be paying for that? I asked the White House yesterday. They referred me to State. State referred me to the Japanese government who didn't respond. It seems as if the Prime Minister was paying and the money was going to Treasury, as previously discussed before. MR. SPICER: You mean when he travels here or to Florida? Q: Mar-a-Lago. MR. SPICER: Okay. Q: Then it seems the White House would know that. MR. SPICER: Yeah, and let me get back to you on that. We'll follow up with you on the exact financing. I'm not sure how that flows, but I'd be glad to find out. Q: Okay. Second question was, during the hearing yesterday that you talked about -- 9th Circuit -- there was some discussion about whether there needed to be a tweak to the executive order to make it clear that legal permanent residents would not be included in that, and there was some back and forth on that. Will there be a tweak?  Q: I think there was further guidance that I spoke about that went out, I think it's been a week ago -- correct me if I'm wrong -- and talked about, we wanted to make it very, very clear that legal permanent residents were not included in that.  But again, remember, we're not talking about the merits of the order. Right now, this discussion that happened last night and that the court will be ruling on is specific to the temporary restraining order and whether or not it should be maintained until there's a further discussion on the merits. So again, I don't want to get into the legal nuances, but right now the guidance is very clear that was issued several days ago, if not a week ago, that this is not about legal permanent residents. So I just -- that they are excluded from this, and I don't know why there would be that discussion. That clarification has been made. Jeff. Q: Sean, you said you're not talking about the merits of the order. Was the President this morning talking about the merits of the order when he called it ""disgraceful,"" the hearing that he heard last night? MR. SPICER: He wasn't arguing before the 9th Circuit, Jeff. Last night was a motion before the 9th Circuit on the temporary restraining order. I think the President was very clear that U.S. code and the Constitution clearly give the President all the authority that is needed to make sure that he can regulate who comes into this country and prevent any acts of -- you know, anyone who is not coming to this country in a peaceful manner. The code, 8 U.S. Code 1152* [1182], is very, very clear on this. And so I think the President was pointing out the same issue that we had in Boston, which is, once we had a chance to argue it on the merits, we won on it. And so I think that's what he's -- he clearly did not argue in front of the 9th Circuit last night. So -- Q: But he called it ""disgraceful."" By calling it ""disgraceful,"" is that the type of language that should be used between branches of government? MR. SPICER: I think that the President, when you look at the U.S. code and how clear it's written and the authority and power it gives the President to do what is necessary to keep this country safe and regulate who comes into this country, I think it's a very, very clear reading, and the President was very -- I think he further went on and said, it doesn't matter what level of education you're at, I don't think you could misread this. So I think -- Q: But isn't that insulting an appointee to the federal bench? MR. SPICER: I think he was very clear, Jeff. So thank you.  Daniel Halper. Q: I was curious about the tweet that President Trump -- about his daughter's brand, and then it was retweeted by the POTUS account. What's the standard that the President is doing in regards to his family businesses or that businesses -- MR. SPICER: Well, I think this was less about his family business and an attack on his daughter. He ran for President. He won. He's leading this country. And I think for people to take out their concern about his actions or his executive order on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success.  So, look, when it comes to his family, I think he's been very clear how proud he is of what they do and what they've accomplished, and for someone to take out their concern with his policies on a family member of his is just -- is not acceptable, and the President has every right as a father to stand up for them. I'm going to go to Norma Garcia from KXTX. Q: Thank you. In Texas there is a big push to penalize sanctuary cities. In this state and other states around the country, there is a growing concern among undocumented immigrants whose lives are deeply rooted in the United States and have no criminal records. My question is, is this administration ready to tackle comprehensive immigration reform? If so, can you give us a timeline for it? If not, what is the plan to deal with undocumented immigrants who live in this country long term? MR. SPICER: Thanks, Norma. I think this has come up several times. I don't think that anybody doubts the President's concern or priority that is placed on immigration. He has talked about it -- when you talk about a comprehensive approach, he has talked about building a wall, he's talked about making sure we go after criminals in this country, he's talked about walking through the process and addressing DACA and DAPA in time. I think this is a big problem. There is no question that both on the security side and on reforming the current immigration system that is so clearly broken, that he is walking through this already, both in terms of executive action and then will continue to work through Congress. So to your question about the timeline, I think he's already enacting several pieces of it and he's going to work with Congress to get further down that. Eamon Javers. Q: Sean -- MR. SPICER: Hallie.  Q: Two here. Playing off of questions from Daniel here, on the business activities that you describe the President taking offense to, Nordstrom has come out and says this was not a political decision, it was a business decision. Ivanka Trump, as you know, has said she has divorced herself, separated herself from the business. So how is she being treated unfairly if she's not part of -- MR. SPICER: Well, I think there's clearly a targeting of her brand, and it's her name still out there. So she's not directly running the company, it's still her name on it and there's clearly efforts to undermine that name based on her father's positions on particular policies that he's taken. This is a direct attack on his policies and her name. And so there is clearly an attempt for him to stand up for her because she is being maligned because they have a problem with his policies. John Roberts. Q: Sean, just a second -- actually, to clarify that, the timing of that tweet? It looked like it was right after his PDB -- during? Can you just --  MR. SPICER: I've heard the conjecture. He was free when that happened. Thank you for asking. Q: Second question was on the lawsuit --  MR. SPICER: No, that's two. Q: Oh, I'm sorry, that was a clarification of the one. (Laughter.)  Q: Good, Hallie. Q: The President tweeted today that if he does not prevail in the court, talking about the lawsuit issue, that we will never be safe, we will never have the safety and security we're entitled to. What does that mean? Does that mean that this is the only tool in his toolbox and if this EO gets batted down by the courts, we're toast? MR. SPICER: No. But I think that when you -- and I mean, again, let's -- 8 U.S. Code 1182 says whenever the President finds that the entry of an alien or any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation such periods as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of aliens or any class of aliens or immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens restrictions he may deem necessary and appropriate.  I guess at some point, if you don't look at that statute and say that the President has the power that Congress and the President have deemed necessary to keep this country safe, you've got to wonder how far you're going to allow that to get eroded. So the point is, is that at some area, you've got to wonder if the President isn't able to execute on the power that's been vested into him and is codified in U.S. code, at some point you have to wonder what else is at question. We have a President that acted 100 percent lawfully to keep people out of this country from seven countries that we did not have the proper information to ensure they were coming into this country with the appropriate means and motives. If at some point the President doesn't have the power, as given to him in law, to protect this country, I think that really questions what a slippery slope we're on. John. Q: Sean, two questions. MR. SPICER: Of course. (Laughter.)  Q: The President said this morning that he paid very close attention to the arguments before the 9th last night. MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: But was he happy with the presentation that the DOJ attorney, August Flentje, made? There was some concern by supporters of this extreme vetting program that he wasn't strong enough. He seemed to be searching for answers, particularly on the point of standing. MR. SPICER: I think there was a lot of back and forth during that entire argument. He made some solid points, and I think that he did what he had to represent the President's case and to represent the administration's case on the TRO. I think the President has really focused on the merits of this case, and looking forward to getting it back either to the 9th Circuit or to the lower court, or however it has to move. He feels very confident on the merits, and that's where I think his focus has been.  So I don't -- I'm not concerned. I think the President's main concern has been on the merits of this case and making sure that an executive order that was lawfully executed and went through the entire process -- remember we've got to go back and remember that the DOJ's Office of Legal Compliance vetted this order, deemed it was legal. So we've followed the entire process to make sure that this was done correctly, constitutionally, legally, and every otherwise.  And so to now -- now our focus is making sure, whether or not we have to wait a day or two or whatever for the TRO, we look forward to the opportunity to discuss this on the merits. Jen Jacobs. Q: Whoa, whoa, whoa -- sorry. Hold on. Just as a point of clarification -- I've got a question --  MR. SPICER: Now you're going with Halle's --  Q: So he is -- he was happy with his presentation --  MR. SPICER: I think he is looking forward to the merits of this discussion. That's where -- and I think he was pleased with some of the points that got made. But his focus is on the merits of the order and making sure that ultimately we're able to do what we can to get this order back in place and protect the American people.  Jen. Q: The Muslim Brotherhood --  Q: Question two.  MR. SPICER: Look at what Hallie started. (Laughter.)  Q: We have reported that Russia has sent its biggest shipment of missiles ever to Syria. Just wondering what the White House's reaction is. MR. SPICER: I think I'll have to -- we don't have any comment on this at this time. Jen. Q: The Muslim Brotherhood. Is it accurate that the administration is weighing -- labeling the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization? And will you do the same for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard? MR. SPICER: I think there is no one that can question the President's commitment to fully attacking and addressing the threat that we face by radical Islamic terrorism. He has been -- made very clear during the campaign that the first step is understanding, knowing, and proclaiming who the enemy is. And he's going to do whatever it takes. That being said, I'm not going to get ahead of any announcements that we may or may not have coming in the near future. But make no mistake, the President understands the threat that our nation faces, and he's going to do everything he can to attack it, root it out, and destroy it. Cecilia. Q: Thank you. The President also said today that in the last two weeks he's learned a lot, and that terrorism is far greater -- and that terrorism is a far greater threat than people understand. That sounds like he is telling the American public that they have something to fear. Is there a specific threat that he is talking about? And should the American public -- based on that statement right there -- be fearful? MR. SPICER: No. But I think the American people should understand that the President is committed to doing this. We face a very, very real threat in ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism, and that we've got to do everything he can, and that the reason that he is taking the steps that he is, is because we must remain ever vigilant. We can't let our guard down. We have to be ahead of the curve. And that the President is going to take the steps necessary to protect this country and its people. And that the idea that we should sit back and not fully appreciate the constant threat that we're in, it's week after week, month after month that we're hearing of another instance -- a lone wolf, et cetera, et cetera -- that is going throughout this country -- excuse me, throughout the world. My apologies. And so I think what the President is doing is trying to make sure that the American people understand that he's doing everything he can to protect them and to keep our institutions and our people safe. And so this is not something that we can rest on our laurels, that we can't understand. He was just down at CENTCOM and SOCOM Monday morning getting a full briefing of the threat that we face from around the world and their motives. And I think that that's something that he weighs very heavily on his mind when he meets with these people, gets these briefings, meets with the Green Beret soldiers, that he recognizes that there are so many people out there putting their life on the line to protect this country and to make sure that we understand the threats, and that it's his job and his obligation to do everything within his power to take that information and do what he can to protect the country. And so just to put a pin in it, I just want to be clear. While we may not face an imminent threat today, we don't know when that next threat comes. Is it next week? Is it next month? Is it next year? But the President wants to get ahead of the curve and make sure that we're not talking about what we should have done, but taking every step necessary to make sure that it doesn't happen.  Steve. Q: But is the threat today greater than it was yesterday or last week? Because that's what he's saying. MR. SPICER: I understand what he's saying. What I'm telling you is, is that we shouldn't ever be behind the curve on the threats this country faces. We should make sure -- we don't know when the next one is coming. We don't know when the next lone wolf is coming. We don't know when the next attack is. We've got amazing intelligence that's trying to root out and make sure that it doesn't happen again. But what we can't do is wait for the next attack to come and say, I wish we had done the following. And the steps that he's taken are proactively making this country and our people safer. Steve. Q: Sean, what was the White House response to the Republican proposal for a carbon tax floated today? And separately, could you just set up tomorrow's meeting with the airline CEOs a little bit? What do you hope to get out of it? What do you hope to discuss? MR. SPICER: So I'm not going to comment on pending legislation. We'll wait to see where that comes. That's just not going to be a habit of ours to comment on every bill that gets introduced or marked up in committee until we have a statement of administration policy.  And with respect to the meeting tomorrow, I'll have a further readout on that later tomorrow. But I will say, in general, as you know, he's met with Intel just now. He met with oil executives -- I mean, executives from the car manufacturers, manufacturing companies, technological companies, unions. So these continued meetings that you'll see in the next months and years are going to be an attempt to make sure that he's sitting down with business leaders from around the country to figure out how he can use his office and this administration to further their ability to create jobs and grow the economy.  So this is going to be more of a pattern. You're going to continue to see him meeting with people who want to share that agenda to grow, create jobs, manufacture here, lift wages up here, bring benefits to good-paying jobs, et cetera. Q: Should we take any significance from the fact that you did have this meeting about the carbon tax? MR. SPICER: No. I just -- look, we're not at a policy -- we have nothing to announce on that.  If I can go now to our next seat -- sorry -- we've got Josh Smith from WJHL in Southwest Virginia. Q: First off, thanks so much for taking questions from journalists covering local news. We appreciate it. WJHL is in Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia -- that is coal country. And I have two questions relating to coal. Then-candidate Trump came to Abingdon, Virginia last year and he made a bold promise -- if it helped to rescue the mining industry, that he would help to bring coal jobs and he would push back against environmental regulations.  If the executive order last week was a first step, what specifically is the President willing to do, planning to do to make good on that promise to help the coal industry, to encourage coal production and use, and to deal with what some call its demonized image?  And as a follow-up -- and I've got to ask two questions because when am I ever going to get to do this again? What assurances can the President give those who hear him talking about him pushing back against environmental regulations and bringing back coal? What assurances can he give those who are very worried about the impact on the environment? MR. SPICER: Well, I think that there's this -- well, I think when you hear him talk about coal specifically, it's under the guise of clean coal. And I think the technology that we're able to utilize these days make it one of the cleanest uses of technology that we have. And the President's point is that as we bring back this industry, we can do it in a way that is environmentally friendly and it becomes a great and greater energy source for us. Just the other day, the Department of Energy noted that we expect I think it's about a 3 percent increase in coal production in this country, which is a noticeable reverse of where it's been in the past. You mentioned the executive order and the talks that the President has had over the past year or so about his desire to bring back coal.  Largely, that has to do with regulation that the EPA has put on existing coal plants that have ensured that they couldn't operate in an effective way to stay open. I think the President is working with industry to roll back a lot of that and do it in a way that's environmental-friendly. And I think that you can do that utilizing the technology you have and harness the power of clean coal, Josh. Thanks. Kristen. Q: Sean, Yemen has withdrawn permission for the United States to run special operations in ground missions against suspected terrorists in the wake of the recent raid there that claimed so many civilian lives. Does that not undercut the administration's ability to fight terrorism in that region? And do you stand by your assessment that it's a success? MR. SPICER: Well, I'll take the last one first. It's absolutely a success. And I think anyone who would suggest it's not a success does disservice to the life of Chief Ryan Owens. He fought knowing what was at stake in that mission. And anybody who would suggest otherwise doesn't fully appreciate how successful that mission was, what the information that they were able to retrieve was, and how that will help prevent future terrorist attacks. Q: But even Senator John McCain --  MR. SPICER: I understand that. I think my statement is very clear on that, Kristen. I think anybody who undermines the success of that raid owes an apology and [does] a disservice to the life of Chief Owens. Q: Are you saying that Senator John McCain owes him an apology? MR. SPICER: Hold on, Kristen, can I answer the question? I'm answering the question. Please let me finish. The raid -- the action that was taken in Yemen was a huge success. American lives will be saved because of it. Future attacks will be prevented. The life of Chief Ryan Owens was done in service to this country and we owe him and his family a great debt for the information that we received during that raid. I think any suggestion otherwise is a disservice to his courageous life and the actions that he took. Full stop. I'm sorry, what was the first part? Q: Is that your message to Senator John McCain? He's called it a failure. MR. SPICER: That's my message to anybody who says that. Anybody. I just -- I don't know how much clearer I can be, Kristen. Hunter Walker. Q: Yes, thank you, Sean. This morning, President Trump asked local law enforcement officials to help assist with deportations. If he doesn't get the cooperation he's hoping for, does he plan to have DHS and CBP proactively begin deportations of undocumented criminals in the border zone? MR. SPICER: Well, I think that when you talk about immigration and what he's doing -- whether it's the wall or enforcing existing regulations or visa reform -- I don't think anybody questions the President's commitment to border security and immigration reform. In fact, it's usually quite the opposite. So when it comes to the steps that he's going to take, I think I've addressed this multiple times what his priorities are going to be, but you've seen Secretary Kelly talk about construction of the wall, his implementation of the executive order to keep people out. There is going to be a considerable amount of action on this front -- on immigration and border security. It started day one and it's going to continue through the last possible day until the President feels that this border is 100 percent secure and we've got the immigration system completely under control. Q: Is defunding his only tool to get cooperation from the sanctuary cities? MR. SPICER: Look, I'm not going to get ahead of it. I think when you saw the support and some of the side conversations that the sheriffs and police officers had, and the conversations that we've had beyond that, the sheriffs the other day, the support that they've issued on behalf of his executive actions and his agenda as a whole -- these are the folks on the front lines in many cases, Hunter, that are on the border, that see what some of this does and how it affects families and businesses, not to mention the cost that it is to both our country, in terms of what we have to do to support the immigration at our southern border in particular, but also the cost that it has on our economy and on jobs. So you're going to continue to see a flurry of activity, over and over and over again, to make sure that this President continues to show the importance that he puts on both border security and immigration reform. Q: Thank you, Sean. Yesterday, on CNN, Kellyanne Conway announced that Prime Minister Trudeau is going to be here next week. Can you confirm which day? Have discussions on reviewing the Canadian part of NAFTA started? And can you confirm that Sarah Palin is being considered as ambassador to Ottawa? MR. SPICER: So I will have further updates on the Prime Minister's schedule either later today or tomorrow. I'm not in a position where I can finalize that. But we will have --  Q: And all the other (inaudible) -- MR. SPICER: Guys, slow your roll. (Laughter.) So we will -- with respect to the ambassador, we have no additional ambassador nominations or announcements to make on that front. I'm sure, at some point, we will have soon. With respect to the agenda, as the President spoke with Prime Minister Trudeau a few weeks ago, they talked about trade and security and commerce, and I think all of that is going to be discussed at the time when the President and him further meet or discuss this. Q: And I wanted to follow up on that if you don't mind. Just on NATO, Canada, of course, is one of the 28 member countries. The President has been calling out countries that pay their fair share of dues. What are his options if countries don't listen to him? And what does this really mean? MR. SPICER: Well, I think -- look, every country is obligated to pay two percent of their GDP, and the President has made it very clear that, for too long, many countries have been getting a free ride. When he has talked to these countries, and as I've just read out, both Erdogan and Rajoy -- he has addressed this not just with them, but to so many of the other NATO countries. And, by and large, every single one of them agrees with that. They understand the importance of NATO, and the President is very clear that in order for NATO to be successful, these folks have to pay their fair share. Carol Lee.  Q: I want to follow on Kristen, and then I just have a question on Turkey. Does the White House have a reaction to reports that Yemen has revoked permission for the U.S. to do ground missions there? MR. SPICER: Yemen, more than most countries, fully appreciates the fight that we have with ISIS, and I think we're going to continue to work with them to strengthen our diplomatic relationships and understand our fight against terrorism. And so at this point, I'll leave it at as that we understand that we share that commitment with them, and we're going to continue to work with them to combat ISIS and to make sure that we do that. I'm not in a position to go any further at this time. Q: President Erdogan said today that the U.S. agreed to work with Turkey to take Raqqa. Can you clarify what the President said to him in that phone call? MR. SPICER: I can't. I think the readout was as specific as we want to get with his conversation. Q: What's his characterization of the conversation? MR. SPICER: I think the readout that we put out on Turkey was as far as we want to go with that. Thank you. Hold on, I'm going to go to our last one, Adriana Cohen, a radio host and columnist for the Boston Herald. Q: Great to be with you, Sean. Last night, Boston Mayor Walsh went on a television show to talk about sanctuary cities. What does the President make of his vow to house illegal immigrants in Boston City Hall to shield them from the Trump administration? MR. SPICER: I think the President's executive order is pretty clear when it comes to these kind of actions. Again, I referenced it earlier in the briefing, but it's twofold. One is, there's a concern about the safety of the American people and how we let people come into this country, and second, with respect to the American taxpayer. And if we're going to be sending federal tax dollars to folks to Washington, I think they need to be used appropriately. And the President is going to do everything in his power to respect the money that taxpayers send to Washington and is spent facilitating legal activities and on American citizens.  Blake. Q: Thanks, Sean. Earlier today, the President said that the wall is in the process of being designed. Given his previous background, is he or does he plan on being actively involved with the designing and the implementation of that wall? And separately, last night, Elizabeth Warren -- any reaction from the White House on whether you believe what Mitch McConnell did was the correct thing? Critics say she was silenced on the Senate floor. MR. SPICER: On the wall, I mean, the President is a builder. He understands and I think he's going to make sure that as this project moves forward, that he's going to stay in close touch with Secretary Kelly to make sure that it fits his specs. But he takes enormous attention to detail, and he wants to make sure it gets done right. So I would expect that a project of this magnitude and one that is this high on his priority list will get the necessary attention from the President. Q: And Senator Warren? MR. SPICER: I'm sorry? Q: Senator Warren last night? MR. SPICER: Yeah, look, I would refer you back to Senate rules. I mean, this is not something that we tend to discuss here. I'll leave it to Senator McConnell and the Senate to discuss Senate rules. Q: I just wanted to follow up again on Yemen. Just not sure exactly what you're trying to say here. I seems like the report was that the Yemeni government has asked the U.S. to stop doing any ground operations with regard to AQAP. Is that the request that you got from the Yemeni government? MR. SPICER: We'll have further information on that going forward. I think we are in touch with Yemeni officials. We're working this through diplomatic channels. But they understand the fight and the commitment that we both share when it comes to rooting out ISIS. And I'll have more information on that going forward. Q: So can I ask on the President's tweet, Hallie had mentioned on part of it. The other part of it this morning was that there's been a big increase in traffic to the U.S. from certain areas. Can you say what certain areas he's referring to, and what data is he leaning on? MR. SPICER: I'll get back to you on that. I've got to pull the data field on that.  Margaret. Q: Sean, two questions. Turkey -- did the President dispatch the CIA director to Turkey as Turkish reports are saying right now? MR. SPICER: I just saw the CIA director, so if it happened, it hasn't happened in the last hour. Q: Okay. The rest of that question was about -- this is part one -- about G—ålen, whether there was discussion of extraditing Fetullah G—ålen who Turkey views as a terrorist. MR. SPICER: I have nothing further than the readout at this time.  Q: The second question, though, was about your statement -- ""We don't know when the next lone wolf is coming."" I believe, based on numbers, that the vast majority of lone-wolf attacks have been carried out by people who are either American, American-born, or naturalized American citizens. So what specifically are you referring to there? And what is he doing about those who are radicalized in front of their own computer screens? MR. SPICER: Well, I guess my question, Margaret -- I mean, I think there's at least -- just for example, within the seven countries that we've talked about, there's at least 20-some odd people that, over the last few years, have come into this country and been convicted of or charged with acts of terrorism. So the -- Q: But the people who are lone wolves and radicalized here. MR. SPICER: I understand that. But what I'm getting at is, you don't know, I don't know when is the next act, who's going to commit it, how are they going to commit it. The point is, is that you don't look at odds and say, hey, let's play the odds on American lives. You do exactly what you can to present any attack from occurring. And so I think you can go through any system and say, when was the last time that somebody committed a shoe bomb, and so let's not take shoes off. The TSA -- Q: That's not what I'm asking. MR. SPICER: No, I get what you're asking. You're asking, when is the next terrorist attack, and we don't know. Q: No, what is being done about people who are radicalized in the basement, in front of the computer screen, who are not affected by this ban. MR. SPICER: Right. And I think the President has asked both for a plan to defeat ISIS from stuff that is coming in from this, and he's taking steps but he's also looking at working with the FBI and domestic intelligence agencies to gather the best information we can to prevent acts on our soil from people, wherever they may be. Q: So something more is being done on that front that we haven't heard about? MR. SPICER: He has tasked the FBI. It is a whole-of-government approach to what's going on. We're not looking at this myopically and just saying, these are the seven countries. The whole point of that first executive ban* [order], and I know that's not entirely what you're asking, was to start with countries that didn't have the appropriate vetting measures to ensure that they could come into this country. As we move forward through this 90-day period, we're reviewing other countries, other options. Those are the external threats coming into this country. At the same time, the President has looked at options within the domestic intelligence gathering to figure out whether it's cyber or other ways that we can determine other ways to prevent or get ahead of additional threats that we might face in this country. But it's not an either/or proposition. It's a whole-of-government approach to what's going on. Q: A bipartisan group of senators are introducing legislation -- and I know you don't like to talk about legislation -- that would allow the Senate to sign off on a reduction in sanctions against Russia. Would the President support such a check by Congress on sanctions? MR. SPICER: Well, there's two sets of sanctions, Tamara, that we got to deal with, right? One is the ones with respect to Crimea. And I think that Ambassador Haley has addressed that very forcefully at the U.N., that until Russia leaves Crimea, that those sanctions are a non-starter. With respect to the other ones, I don't want to get ahead of the legislation, if that's what that specifically is dealing with. But again, we're not going to get into pending legislation.  With respect to the sanctions that specifically deal with Ukraine and Crimea, I think that Ambassador Haley has spoken very, very clearly about that.  Q: Sean, thanks. The President said this morning in his address to the law enforcement officials, that he'll have a zero-tolerance policy for attacks against law enforcement officers. As a specific policy proposal, what does that mean exactly? More death penalty cases on the federal level? What does he mean? MR. SPICER: I think that what the President said not just yesterday with his meeting with the sheriffs, but then today, is that he wants them to understand that he is a true friend -- they have a true friend in the White House, somebody who understands the dangers that they face every day by putting their lives on the line to protect the American people, whether it's pulling someone up for a traffic stop and not knowing what's in the car, or going up to a house to serve a warrant and not knowing who's behind that door. These men and women, every day, day in and day out, are willing to put their lives on the line and make huge sacrifices.  So he wants them to know that they have a true friend here in the White House that's going to have their back. How that manifests itself going forward, I think the President will have further details as that moves forward. But for right now, I think his number-one message to them was: You've got a friend, he's got your back, let's do what we can to get these cities.  I think the other thing that was important is that, you know, he mentioned Chicago. Their crime rate -- their murder rate is up 45, 50 percent. And in so many of these cities it's up. It's unacceptable. And I think the President is disgusted that so many American lives are taken, injured, whatever -- that we can't walk down the streets of our own cities in safety. And I think he wants to make sure that they understand his commitment not just to preventing acts of terrorism from coming into this country, but also that whether it's gang violence or whatever, that people feel safe and that law enforcement is empowered to do what it can to keep our community safe, to work with communities, to establish policies that both respect our citizens but do so in a way that makes them feel safe and allows them to drive and walk down the streets of our city. Charlie. Q: Journalist Matt Drudge tweeted today that the Republican Party should be sued for fraud, basically upset about the lack of any legislation to repeal Obamacare or any tax cut legislation. So what's your message to him and anyone else who's worried about sort of the big push in the beginning and who might be concerned that that momentum is stalling? MR. SPICER: I think it's hardly stalling. I think it's a mammoth thing to repeal and replace. I think there's no question the President's commitment to doing this. You've heard Speaker Ryan talk about how we should be able to have this wrapped up by the end of the year. It's a big bill. It got jammed through, and it was very sweeping. We're talking about one-fifth of our economy. We can either do it quickly, as the Democrats did, and end up with a monstrosity where premiums go up, access is limited, or we can do it right.  And I think the President, while he wants to get this done as soon as possible and understand what's at stake, he wants to do it right. He understands how important health care is to American families and individuals. And so his goal is to get it done right and have an outcome that achieves the goals that it sets out to do. That's it -- plain and simple. April. Q: Sean, I have a series of questions.  MR. SPICER: Look what you started, Hallie Jackson. (Laughter.)  Q: Don't blame it on Hallie, okay? Going back to the issue of policing, what happens when there is a situation -- you're talking about good policing -- but what happens when there are situations that we've seen over the last few years that have been highlighted with this accountability piece with cameras? What happens when there is bad policing? What does this President -- MR. SPICER: Then we have to deal with it. I don't -- I think the President wants to do what he can. But again, I think you're right, we've got to have good policing. But that's -- he wants to stand with them, talk about how we can do proper training, what kind of funding they need to do their job better. In so many cases, the policy are asking for the resources because they've become fearful of making routine stops by preventing it.  So I think it's working with the police, integrating those kind of back and forth and having a dialogue in communities to make sure that we're doing it, as you put it, in a way that instills confidence in our citizens and our communities. But we can do this right. And we can make sure -- Q: So it's not an either/or, though? MR. SPICER: No, absolutely no.  Q: Okay. MR. SPICER: No, no, no. We've got to do this -- look, police officers from around this country on a daily basis put their lives out there, and I think that they want to keep communities safe. Like teachers, they enter this not -- no cop signs up, or sheriff, because of the money. Like teachers, they do it because they care about the community. They care about making this country better, their community better. But I think, in return, they should be provided the resources and the policies they need to do their job well and to do so that ensures that we have this back-and-forth dialogue with the American people that continues to earn the respect that they deserve for the sacrifice they're making. Q: All right, the next question.  MR. SPICER: How many have we got? Just so I -- Q: Maybe three -- maybe three more. (Laughter.) It's Black History Month. Let me go. (Laughter.)  MR. SPICER: You can play that once. (Laughter.)  Q: I got a couple more days.  MR. SPICER: Okay. (Laughter.)  Q: All right, so listen, on the issue of last evening with Elizabeth Warren. Coretta Scott King -- I want to get your reaction to these words that they're not allowed: ""Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge."" And she's basically saying that Sessions has indifference towards criminal violations of civil rights laws. What do you say to that? MR. SPICER: Well, obviously, we have a lot of respect for her and the sacrifices that she made, and the sacrifices that, frankly, she endured in her life. But I would respectfully disagree with her assessment of Senator Session then and now. His records on civil voting rights I think is outstanding. And like Arlen Specter, the late Arlen Specter, I can only hope that if she was still with us today, that after getting to know him and to see his record and his commitment to voting civil rights, that she would share the same view that Senator Specter did where he said, ""Although I voted against him, getting to know the man that is now, I regret that vote."" And I would hope that if she was still with us today that she would share that sentiment.  Because Senator Sessions's records both as U.S. attorney for Alabama, as attorney general, and as senator has been one that has stood up for voting rights. He prosecuted the Klan. He stood up for Coretta Scott King getting -- for getting the gold medal. He has been a tireless advocate of voting and civil rights throughout his career. And I would just hope that if she was still with us today, that she would share the sentiments of former Senator Specter. Q: Okay, and last two. On diversity here, the administration's diversity issues, you've been slammed on that recently. I understand that there's been a meeting. Vice President Pence has been talking to J.C. Watts, Michael Steele and others -- if you can elaborate on that. And also there's a lot of groundswell about this HBCU executive order. What's going on with that?  MR. SPICER: So the HBCU presidents will be in town later this month as part of a national celebration. We'll have further updates on both the meetings that we may have with them, the activities surrounding that, in terms of the administration. And then I think we'll have further updates on it, as I mentioned with all executive orders. We have nothing to update on that. But obviously, the President has a strong commitment to them and understands over the last eight years they've been woefully neglected. And I think he wants to really show a commitment in funding to HBCUs. And so you'll see I think not just a push this month, but in his budget and going forward. Q: PLUS loans, Pell grants?  MR. SPICER: I think his budget will address a lot of these issues, April. Q: The diversity piece, the diversity piece. MR. SPICER: And I think -- look, we're going to continue to reach out to a lot of folks to get their ideas and their input. I think he's shown that both through the transition and now. But we're going to continue to reach out to people of different backgrounds, of different color, of different gender, of different economic -- socioeconomic, of different industry, of different parties. The President I think continues to show a desire to reach out and talk to people who I think share an agenda of moving the country forward and doesn't really care about their background, their voting history, any of those other ideological traits. If they share a commitment to moving this country forward and lifting people up, that's his end of -- Q: Sean --  Q: You mentioned the ""one in, two out"" order in your opening. There was a lawsuit filed in federal court this morning challenging that lawsuit. Is the White House aware of that?  MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: And what's your response to it? MR. SPICER: Well, I think the lawsuit presumes a lot of outcomes that are widely inaccurate. I think that it presumes that certain things would be part of the ""one out."" The bottom line is, is that overregulation has stemmed economic growth and job creation. Reviewing those to make sure that they are meeting their intent and not stifling job creation at the expense of whatever they were intended to do is something that should be smart and welcome by everybody.  The idea that we're willy-nilly just allowing regulations to occur, but the lawsuit specifically, is wildly inaccurate. It makes a ton of assumptions that call for speculation on what may or may not happen in the future. And that's highly -- it's just subjective at best and doesn't have any basis in fact. Thank you, guys. Look forward to seeing you tomorrow.  Q: More hands up here, Sean. MR. SPICER: I know, I'll see them tomorrow.  END 2:38 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-02-09,"1:53 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Here we go. Good afternoon, everyone. As you just saw, the President was honored to host the swearing-in of Attorney General Sessions in the Oval Office just a short time ago.  Under Attorney General Sessions, the Justice Department will return to its original, core mission: to uphold the rule of law to ensure that justice is administered and enforced fairly and impartially for all Americans. Attorney General Sessions is a world-class legal mind and experienced prosecutor, and the President is pleased to have him finally in place as our nation's top law enforcement officer. After the Attorney General's swearing-in, the President signed three executive orders dedicated to standing behind the police officers who risk their lives every day to protect us and our communities, reducing crime, and stopping cartel violence.  The first executive order directs the newly installed Attorney General to develop a strategy for more effectively prosecuting people who commit violence against members of law enforcement. We must better protect those who protect us. Our men and women in blue need to know that we're with them 100 percent as they patrol our streets.  Unfortunately, this has not always been the case. Law enforcement officials have been vocal about the lack of support they received under the past administration. This lack of support demoralized many officers and, in some cases, led to their discouraging their engagement with local communities, only causing further harm and deterioration. It's imperative that federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies better coordinate and share information across jurisdictions to better serve and protect our communities. This order will start the important work of doing just that, instituting a holistic approach that involves the whole of government. It also directs the Department of Justice to work with other federal agencies to come up with ways to further reduce violence against law enforcement, and orders a hard look at how the Department of Justice and other agencies use their law enforcement grants.  The second order establishes a task force, led by the new Attorney General, to reduce crime and restore public safety in communities across America. Together, the members of this task force are going to come up with specific recommendations -- how we can change existing federal law to better prevent crime and improve public safety, and develop stronger working relationships with our state and local partners. The President is confident that this task force will develop a systematic strategy to help further protect the American people. Communities across our nation have been devastated by a surge in violent-crime rates, particularly in our major cities. Over the last eight years, we've experienced declining focus on law and order. Crime reduction will clearly be a priority for this White House. The last executive order re-focuses the energy and resources of the federal government to dismantle transnational criminal organizations, such as drug cartels. It's important to emphasize that we cannot reduce crime in the United States without additionally addressing illegal immigration and illegal drugs. Through this executive order, the President instructs the Attorney General to form a comprehensive and decisive approach to destroying transnational crime organizations and drug cartels. These cartels represent a clear and present danger to our nation. They bring dangerous criminals, drugs, and violence to once-peaceful neighborhoods both here at home and in other parts of the world. They have fueled addiction and overdose deaths, and they can no longer be allowed to operate with impunity in our country or our hemisphere. This order pulls together the experience and resources of federal agencies to work towards emphasizing specific goals in this regard. Number one, to upgrade our information-gathering about these transnational organizations and cartels. Without accurate information about these threats, and the ability and willingness to share this information, we're not going to be able to tackle this problem.  It's important to note that, prior to this administration, if you had called the Department of Justice to ask for these statistics, they never kept them. So knowing what we're facing is a big part of addressing the problem. Number two, improving the speed and efficiency of removing criminal aliens, cartel members, and people who help cartels from our nation. Unlike during the last eight years, these criminals are finally going to go home. Three, shift whatever resources we can to tackling these organizations and prevent them from disrupting our society any further. Now, on to the President's schedule. This morning, the President held a breakfast and listening session with key stakeholders in the airline industry. We've got a participant list if you're interested. The President thanked the attendees for the 10 million jobs and $1 trillion in annual economic activity they contribute to our economy, and praised them for moving approximately 2 million passengers per day in spite of the outdated infrastructure and equipment that they have in terms of air traffic control and other infrastructure measures. The President asked the aviation leaders what the government can do to help their industry grow and create more well-paying jobs for Americans. The leaders commented that they had never been given the opportunity to truly work alongside the President in such an open and constructive way. And they were unanimous in asking for the President to offer relief from the duplicative and burdensome regulations that are stifling job creation, which he assured them he'd do. The President also reaffirmed his commitment to foregoing -- to forging, rather, public-private partnerships that will rebuild America's crumbling infrastructure. He pledged to work closely with the airline industry to modernize the technology systems that keep our nation's airports running, and to expedite the approval process for future airline infrastructure projects. It's the President's goal to make sure the United States has the most advanced airline system in the world, and this meeting was an important first step in achieving that. After the executive order signing, the President spoke with the President of Afghanistan and the Emir of Qatar. My understanding is that we should have readouts shortly on both of those calls.  Just concluding, a few moments ago the President held a Supreme Court and legislative listening session and lunch with Democratic and Republican senators. In attendance were Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa; Senator Heitkamp of North Dakota; Senator Tester of Montana; Senator Donnelly of Indiana; Senator Manchin of West Virginia; Senator Moore Capito, also of West Virginia; Senator Cornyn of Texas; Senator Alexander Of Tennessee; Senator Coons of Delaware, and Senator Bennet of Colorado. The President expressed his hope that these senators and their colleagues will give Judge Gorsuch a fair consideration and vote based on his qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court. With over 100 federal judicial nominations potentially happening during this administration, it's critical for us to have open dialogue and work towards bipartisan agreement so that our justice system returns to its important work on behalf of the American people. Later today, the President will speak with the Emir of Kuwait and the Prime Minister of Iraq. He will provide readouts -- or we will provide readouts of those calls moving towards the conclusion of them. We also anticipate that the Senate will hold a vote to confirm Secretary-designate Price this evening or into the early hours of Friday to be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services. The President was glad to see that the Army Corps of Engineers announced last night the final easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline. With this final federal authorization completed, and the President working to reduce further unnecessary delays, this infrastructure project can finally continue to move forward. The construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline was one of the President's campaign promises and the subject of one of his first executive orders. The administration is pleased that Americans will be going to work building this pipeline, and building it with American steel whenever possible. Now, looking to the upcoming schedule. Tomorrow, the President will welcome Prime Minister Abe of Japan. The President and the Prime Minister will hold a press conference at 1:00 p.m. in the East Room. They will depart Washington around 3:00 tomorrow afternoon for Mar-A-Lago, where the President is honored to host the Prime Minister at the Winter White House. As we recently announced just earlier today, Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada will visit the White House on Monday. The President looks forward to a constructive conversation and strengthening the deep relationship that exists between the United States and Canada. The President will also host Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel next Wednesday. We'll have further guidance on the press availability potentials for either one of those.  One last thing before I take your questions, amid surging levels of CEO confidence and in the wake of the incredible jobs announcement made at the White House yesterday by Intel, there's also new numbers released today by the Department of Labor showing that unemployment claims are at near historic lows. The President knows better than anyone what businesses need to create jobs, and the market is responding to his policy improvements. This administration will continue to roll back burdensome regulations and lower the overall tax burden on Americans so they can hire even more people and create even more innovative projects.  With that, I'll take your questions. Kaitlan Collins. Q: Thank you. Hundreds of bureaucrats at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau make more than members of Congress. Forty of them make more than Vice President Mike Pence. Does the President have plans to revamp this agency? And if so, does he feel that he should be able to fire the head of the agency at his will? MR. SPICER: I think I've addressed this before, but we have no updates right now on the head of CFPB. If we do, I'll let you know. With respect to the first part of that question, I think one of the things that you're going to continue to see from this President is a respects for taxpayers' dollars, the money they spend, and how they're spent. We are going to continue to review all aspects of government. I think you'll see further announcements as far as how he's going to look at -- how he's going to approach and innovate and update government.  The bottom line is that we should be paying people a fair wage for their service to this country, but that we should doing it in the most effective and efficient manner. And I think that's what the President has already shown towards his commitment towards helping reduce the cost of several programs through the government and bringing back jobs. But there's going to be a respect for taxpayers in this administration, so that whether it's salaries or actual positions or programs, he's going to have a very, very tough look at how we're operating government, how many positions they're in, what people are getting paid.  But the President understands that most Americans are out there working night and day trying to get by, and that Washington truly needs to respect the money that they spend, and that we should be doing it in a way that shows that -- with a level of respect in terms of how many people are hiring, what they're paid, what programs we're looking at, whether or not that program is duplicative. But it's not just about one department or one agency. It's really about looking at how government as a whole operates. John. Q: Sean, questions have been raised after Kellyanne Conway did an interview, I believe it was with Fox News this morning, where she appeared to, from the confines of the Brady Briefing room, promote the products of Ivanka Trump. Do you believe that she crossed an ethical line? MR. SPICER: Kellyanne has been counseled and that's all we're going to go with. She's been counseled on that subject, and that's it. Q: And could I ask a question. Reuters has a story out that includes a partial transcript of the President's call with Vladimir Putin, in which he appears to express doubts about the New START Treaty. Does he indeed have doubts about the New START Treaty? Would he like to see that renegotiated? MR. SPICER: The President's conversation with President Putin is a private call between the two of them, and I'm going to leave it at that. We put a readout on the call, and we have nothing further beyond that. John Gizzi. Q: Thank you, Sean. One question today. MR. SPICER: Wow.  Q: (Laughter.) On February 2nd, Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is a well-known filmmaker in Russia and was a close associate of the late Boris Nemtsov, the dissident, found himself in critical condition. His wife has since said she believes this is poisoning, very much like the conditions that almost took his life two years ago. And does the administration have any comment about that, or the frustration of Mr. Navalny, the opponent of President Putin to get on the ballot as a candidate? MR. SPICER: I think our State Department is aware of the situation, we're monitoring it, and I'll leave it at that. Blake. Q: Sean, the President said today in the airlines representative meeting that he hopes to have an announcement within the next two to three weeks about lowering the burden of taxes for businesses. At the Super Bowl interview, he was asked, can Americans expect a tax break in 2017, and he said, ""I think so, yes. I would like to say yes."" It sounds like he's a little bit more confident for the businesses than individual tax breaks for Americans. Is the business component at this point ahead of the individual component?  MR. SPICER: No, it's a comprehensive -- yeah -- thanks for asking. I think we're looking at, in the next few weeks, rolling out the outline of a comprehensive tax plan that we'll be working with Congress on that will address both the business side of the tax ledger as well as the individual rates. But it's going to be a comprehensive plan, something that we haven't seen since 1986. But I think when you look at the segueing of that, we've got two opportunities for reconciliation this year. One is using the FY17 budget, which you can easily get Obamacare repeal and replace done, and then you can use the FY18 budget to utilize the second opportunity at reconciliation to do comprehensive reform. But we recognize the need. I mean, it's been since 1986 that something like this, of this scale and magnitude, had happened.  The President recognizes that middle-class Americans need tax relief, and that's going to be part of that. But we also recognize -- and you saw that in all of these businesses meetings, whether it's inversions or other means in which people are shipping jobs overseas or reestablishing themselves or the profits that are kept over there -- we need fundamental, comprehensive tax reform that addresses both sides of that income stream.  Q: Can you say if this is going to be a mix between what he had put out there on the campaign and what House Republicans had put out there before? Because there's some similarities but clearly some differences as well. MR. SPICER: I'm just going to say that you're going to have to wait a couple weeks before we put out that outline. But I can tell you that it's something that is going to spur economic growth. It's going to recognize the need to give so many working Americans the relief that they need.  But more importantly, I think part of the issue that we continue to see over and over again with businesses is that we're facing competition from abroad because of our tax code. It favors companies from not wanting to stay, and the President recognizes that. And what he wants to do is create a tax climate that not only keeps jobs here but makes it -- incentivizes companies to want to come here, to grow here, to create jobs here, to bring their profits back here.  So I think -- I don't want to get any further ahead of it, but I will tell you that it is going to be the first time that this nation has seen a full comprehensive tax reform in a long, long time. Yes. Q: Yes, the President this morning tweeted that our country is ""bogged down in conflict all over the place."" Where are we bogged down? MR. SPICER: I think there are several places that we've been --  Q: What does he mean by that? MR. SPICER: I think that if you look at ISIS in particular and the hotspots around the country, the places that we have to monitor, there's a lot of countries through the Middle East in particular -- Northern Africa -- that we are having to address and deal with and monitor because of the threat of radical Islamic terrorism.  There's no question that the spread of it has gone -- in the last eight years has proliferated. And I think that the resources that we have to spend -- this isn't a traditional war where you're just looking at the other enemy with a uniform and saying, here's the country we're fighting. The proliferation of ISIS throughout this country has made it so that we have to focus a lot more in a lot more places and expend a lot more resources because it's more of a disparate approach that we have to employ, as opposed to having one country that you're facing at one time. Q: But ""bogged down"" suggests it's something we can't get out of? MR. SPICER: I just answered the question. I understand. Q: Thank you, Sean. And happy Lantern Festival to you.  MR. SPICER: Happy Lantern Festival to you. Q: Thank you. Regarding the very nice letter that President Trump sent to President Xi Jinping last night, I'm curious about the timing. And also in the letter, President Trump said he's looking forward to the event of constructive relationship with China. So could you elaborate the importance of this bilateral relationship to the U.S.? MR. SPICER: Well, I think it's obviously important to us. And the President understands that. I think he's spoken fairly often about China, and he understands both the national and economic interests that we have, the desire for our companies to access the Chinese market, but also the national security interests that we have. And so he obviously wants to do what he can to have a fruitful and constructive relationship with China, and he looks forward to developing that as we go forward. Sarah. Q: Sean, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan said today that they could use a few thousand more troops in Afghanistan to help the coalition efforts there. Going off Mike's question, if we're trying to get out of conflicts like that, does the administration plan to send those additional forces to Afghanistan?  MR. SPICER: I think the President will heed the advice of the generals and Secretary Mattis. That conversation has yet to happen -- and if we have any further announcements. But I think that's right now a Department of Defense issue that you should raise with. Hallie. Q: Sean, two questions for you. I want to get to one on immigration. But first on the comments from Judge Gorsuch that have been reported out, I just have a two-parter. But does the President still stand by his nomination? MR. SPICER: Absolutely. Q: Given where Gorsuch stands --  MR. SPICER: That's number one? Q: No, the second part of a two-part.  MR. SPICER: Oh. (Laughter.)  Q: Given where --  MR. SPICER: I'm not calling on you anymore.  Q: Given Judge Gorsuch's position on the President's attitude toward the judiciary, and given that the President has praised Neil Gorsuch for his intellect and for his integrity, does the President have any regrets about the comments that he's made about federal judges? MR. SPICER: I think the President's comments speak for -- no, he has no regrets. But he's very proud of the selection that he's made, and he's going to make a great associate justice to the Supreme Court. Q: Now about the selection, but about the comments that he said, for example, about Judge -- MR. SPICER: I understand that, I just -- he has no regrets. Thank you. Q: On immigration, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos -- MR. SPICER: Look what you started, April Ryan. Q: Why are you calling me out? I didn't do anything. (Laughter.)  Q: I know the White House, I'm sure, has been following the situation of Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos. And so I want to know, does the President believe she should have been deported? And what message does he have to others in her position? MR. SPICER: Yeah, I'm going to refer you back to ICE on that. That's an ICE matter.  Q: The President has no comment? MR. SPICER: The issue is developing in Arizona right now, and I would refer you back to ICE. Margaret.  Q: She's in Mexico right now, though. MR. SPICER: I'd refer you back to ICE. Q: Sean, in that lunch meeting, the President said that -- he basically said Senator Blumenthal's comments were taken out of context, and that -- MR. SPICER: Well, no, Judge Gorsuch's comments were -- yeah. Q: Judge Gorsuch, right. And that his relaying of Judge Gorsuch's comments were taken out of context. However, Senator Ayotte, who is working with the White House to help shepherd Judge Gorsuch through the Hill, released a statement confirming those same remarks, ""disheartening"" and ""demoralizing.""  MR. SPICER: Right, so here's what -- Q: Is the President aware of that? Because she was in that meeting. MR. SPICER: No, no, of course he's aware. This is what Senator Ayotte said: ""Judge Gorsuch has made it very clear in all of his discussions with senators, including Senator Blumenthal, that he could not comment on [any] specific cases, and that judicial ethics prevent him from commenting on political matters. He has also emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary, and while he made clear that he was not referencing* [referring to] any specific case, he said that he finds any criticism of a judge's integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing."" So there is a big difference between commenting on the specific comments that had been made in the tweet and his general philosophy about the judiciary and his respect for his fellow judges. And I think the senator's comments were very clear about how those are two distinct issues. Q: Right. And the judge's comments as relayed through others were also in that context of the President's attacks on the judiciary, which is what the senator you just read out was also talking about there.  MR. SPICER: Right. Q: Was the President aware of that? Because Senator Ayotte was sitting right across from him when he said that those comments were inaccurately reported or conveyed. MR. SPICER: No, the way that Senator Blumenthal characterized them, he was talking about the tweets and saying that he was disheartened. That's not what the judge said. He was making two very complete, distinct arguments about how he views the comments that he should not be commenting on a political matter or on specific things. But as a whole, he doesn't like attacks in general on the judiciary. It was a very distinct argument that he was making. And I think that that's where I think we've got to be clear, and that's what Senator Ayotte was saying this morning. Very, very different.  Cecilia.  Q: Is he to take that on board? I mean --  MR. SPICER: Is he what? Q: Is he taking that on board? I mean, you just said he doesn't regret his past attacks on the judiciary.  MR. SPICER: Right. Q: But now you have these confirmed remarks, which you were saying were exactly what the judge was talking about. MR. SPICER: No, no --  Q: And that's not changing the President's own -- MR. SPICER: But hold on -- but, again, I think it's important to understand that the judge was very clear that he was not commenting on any specific matter, right? And then the he was asked about his general philosophy. So you can't then take that -- equate it back to the specific. He literally went out of his way to say, I'm not commenting on a specific instance. So to take what he said about a generalization and apply it to a specific is exactly what he was intending not to do. Q: In other words, the President will continue to speak like this. MR. SPICER: Of course he will. The President is going to speak his mind. It goes back to Thomas Jefferson, that Presidents have commented on judicial nominees. I mean, the idea of one branch talking about or commenting on another branch is as old as our republic.  So I don't know why -- and I find it interesting when President Obama criticized the Supreme Court for its Citizens United comments in the State of the Union, there wasn't a similar concern about that. The idea that this is -- Q: Well, I guess the ""so-called judge"" portion of it, the personal attack. MR. SPICER: But at some point it seems like there is clearly a double standard when it's -- how this is applied. When President Obama did it, there was no concern from this briefing room. When he does it, it's a ton of outrage. So I just -- with all due respect, I think the President has made very clear that he was concerned about how that executive order in particular, which is what we're talking about, was applied. And I think we've addressed it from this briefing room over and over and over again that the U.S. code gives the President very clear authority to make this happen. Cecilia. Q: I want to make sure I understand what you're saying. Are you saying that ""demoralizing"" and ""disheartening"" was not specifically about the President's comments and what he said? And if so, how does the President know that? Has he spoken to the Judge? MR. SPICER: No, I think the Judge literally made it very clear in his comments. Q: But three senators have come out and said that they corroborate that statement, and said that --  MR. SPICER: I understand that. Senator Ayotte, who was there, made it very clear that he was commenting in general about attacks on the judiciary. That was it. Plain and simple. Q: But three other senators have said, and the spokesman and for the Judge, on the record.  MR. SPICER: I understand that, Cecilia. I can tell you that Senator Ayotte, who has been with him on every single thing, was very clear about that. There's no -- so I understand that. And that is -- she has made it very clear over and over again. Yes. Q: Sean, your answer about the context doesn't make sense when you think about what Senator Ben Sasse said today and this morning on TV. He said that he asked Judge Gorsuch specifically about the President's ""so-called judge"" tweet. And in response --  MR. SPICER: Phil, this is like the fourth time I've asked and answered. Q: No, but this is a different context, Sean.  MR. SPICER: I understand that. Phil, I have asked -- Q: This is directly about the President's tweet. MR. SPICER: I understand that. And I've said exactly what Senator Ayotte said about it. I don't know how many times you guys -- Q: But her comment was only about Blumenthal. MR. SPICER: I understand, thank you.  Q: Sean, I'm going to continue on this line, despite what was just happening there. Why isn't the White House, why isn't the President concerned about the influence or the appearance of the influence on the independent judiciary?  MR. SPICER: Why isn't he -- I mean, he is free to speak his mind. Where has this outrage been for the last hundred years? There has been --  Q: I'm not asking about the Obama administration or any previous administration, I'm talking about this President and this White House. MR. SPICER: I understand that. And the President has -- part of the reason the President got elected is because he speaks his mind. He doesn't hold it back. He's authentic. And he's not going to sit back, I think, when he feels very passionately about something as much as the executive order. He was doing it to make sure Americans were safe. The order -- the U.S. code is crystal-clear on this. I think I've read it for like three days in a row. And it can't be any clearer how much authority it gives the President to do what he can to keep us safe. He's concerned that he's doing what he can to keep this country safe, and there has been a lot of activity to stand in the way.  So I'm not sure how many more times I can read the code to you. But 8 U.S. Code, 1182 --  Q: Yes, but you and me talking about it is not how the judicial process works. MR. SPICER: Thank you. You've asked the question now eight times. Q: One more I'd like to ask you. One more about a different set of comments. MR. SPICER: You've got -- hold on. I understand.  Thank you, go ahead. Q: About a different set of comments that have been made, Sean, also from Kellyanne Conway earlier this week. Q: Let him go. Let him go. Q: Earlier this week. You say the -- this is in context of Nordstrom and not about what she was counseled about, but about something she said to CNN earlier this week, is that the President doesn't comment on everything. And so I want to contrast the President's repeated statements about Nordstrom with the lack of comments about some other things, including, for example, the attack on a Quebec mosque and other similar environments. Why is the President -- when he chooses to --  MR. SPICER: Do you -- hold on -- because you just brought that up. I literally stand at this podium and opened a briefing a couple days ago about the President expressing his condolences. I literally opened the briefing about it. So for you to sit there and say --  Q: I was here.  MR. SPICER: I know. So why are you asking why he didn't do it when I literally stood here and did it? Q: The President's statement -- MR. SPICER: I don't understand what you're asking. Q: Kellyanne's comments were about that the President doesn't have time to tweet about everything.  MR. SPICER: Right.  Q: He's tweeting about this. MR. SPICER: Right.  Q: He's not tweeting about something else. MR. SPICER: I came out here and actually spoke about it and said the President spoke -- Q: I'm talking about the President's time.  MR. SPICER: What are you -- you're equating me addressing the nation here and a tweet? I don't -- that's the silliest thing I've ever heard.  Q: I'm talking about an attack on Nordstrom on --  MR. SPICER: Okay, I'm done. This is silly. Okay, next.  Q: -- and an attack on people, and you're equating -- MR. SPICER: Thank you. You've asked your question. Thank you.  Q: Does that not diminish the language that you're using? MR. SPICER: Thank you. Go ahead. Q: Thank you, Sean. One of the criticisms leveled at President Trump's predecessor, President Obama, by Republicans was his excessive use of executive orders. The President signed three more executive orders today. Why isn't that criticism applicable to President Trump in the same manner that President Obama --  MR. SPICER: I think when you look at the context of what they -- yes, what those executive orders did, and there's things that are within the bounds of trying to protect this country and ordering police officers -- nothing that I think even Democrats would complain, with the exception of the one that we've had conversations on. Most of them have been widely praised by both parties to keep this country safe, to get jobs creation back. Most of them have widely applauded.  I think the difference with what President Obama did was stretch the executive order to take actions that had largely been within the realm of Congress, and to do things that didn't allow for prior input. The stuff that the President is doing is almost entirely highly applauded by both sides of the aisle and won tremendous praise. There's a big difference in the context in which those two administrations operated.  Q: One of the criticisms in addition to that was that President Obama in using those EOs was governing by executive fiat, he wasn't working with Congress. Does the President plan to use -- MR. SPICER: Right. But again, I think -- Q: -- Congress in a legislative manner? MR. SPICER: Absolutely. And I just mentioned both tax reform and repealing and replacing Obamacare -- immigration. There are so many areas where the President -- he literally just -- we held up this briefing a little so that eight United States senators could walk out and talk about -- and again, that meeting, while it was focused on the judiciary, they talked about infrastructure. They talked about other priorities that they have.  He has shown a commitment to work across the aisle to bring folks in, to listen, to hear their thoughts, to get ideas on a legislative agenda that they can move together with. So I think there is a big difference between the last administration that sort of shunned Congress's role, and this administration where the President is actively seeking their input and ideas, and helping them craft an agenda to move the country forward. Alexis. Q: Can I follow up on the tax question? MR. SPICER: Sure. Q: Because there are revenue elements of the Affordable Care Act, if it is repealed and replaced -- there has been discussion on the Hill about what would be the appropriate track to get that into tax legislation or how to treat the tax legislation. If the President is interested in unveiling a tax package that is as comprehensive as you just described, would the revenue elements of the Affordable Care Act be on a separate track? Or is he talking about folding them into one reconciliation package? MR. SPICER: So right now, as I mentioned at the outset, I think we're primarily looking at two reconciliation tracks -- one utilizing the 2017 budget. So you could put your Obamacare repeal and replace in the 2017 reconciliation package, and then you could potentially do tax reform -- comprehensive tax reform in the 2018 budget. But I also want to say -- just so we're clear, these aren't prescriptive. I think we continue to work towards Congress on a range of options and ideas to accomplish both of those and other goals. Those seem primarily the two most opportune ways to get this thing done. But I wouldn't want to rule in or anything out. I think both Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell are going to weigh in on what best vehicles can be utilized to make this thing happen. So I don't want to be prescriptive. Ben. Q: You talked about the President's tax reform plan in coming weeks. Is that something he's talked about with leaders in both houses of Congress? And are they prepared for this? MR. SPICER: Absolutely. I mean, as I mentioned, he has met with -- just wrapped up a meeting with Republicans and Democratic senators. But this is something that the legislative affairs team, as well as the President himself has engaged with members of Congress to talk about this both privately and in bigger groups. But there is a very large conversation going on to achieve bipartisan support for a package of this nature. Jonathan. Q: Does the President believe that it's possible to balance the budget without major entitlement reform? Any sort of House -- MR. SPICER: I think one of the things that the President has looked at is not just the cutting side, but the revenue stream. One area in particular -- natural resources regulation and tax reform, how we can grow the economy and bring in additional revenues to the government on the revenue side. So there is a balance to how the President is looking at bringing down the deficit. And I think before I get -- he's going to -- we'll have a budget out in a few weeks. I think that will answer a lot. But again, when it comes to deficit reduction, which is something that he is very interested in, that is not a one-side-of-the-ledger option; that a lot of what he is trying to talk about in these meetings and with business executives is how we can expand the economy. And that expanded economy, that job creation, those explorations of natural resources and additional new jobs also bring additional tax revenue in.  So there's a way to do this. If we start bringing businesses back, creating more things, creating more jobs, that creates a revenue stream that has a significant impact on the deficit -- on being able to drive down the deficit and balancing the budget.  So I think it's not something I want to get in too much detail now, but I will tell you that I think the President has been very, very keen on trying to make sure that we look at the revenue side as much as we're looking at the spending side. When it comes to the spending side, again, you're looking at a whole-of-government approach at how we look at every department, every agency, every job, the spending -- or the hiring freeze being one of them. How do we make sure that we're looking at are these positions necessary? Are they duplicative? Are we using taxpayer money in the best possible way?  Those are the whole -- it isn't a single -- like, look at those particular programs and try to figure out what we can do. He's looking at everything and figuring out if we can make it more effective and efficient. Yes, Scott. Q: Yes, Sean, Monday, the House Oversight Committee is going to mark up Congressman Chaffetz's bill to strike down the District of Columbia's Death with Dignity Act, the assisted suicide law. It could soon come to the White House. Has the President articulated any thoughts on that or the other bills to strike down D.C.'s gun laws, marijuana, funding for federal -- for abortions in the District? Any thoughts on all these things that are coming your way? MR. SPICER: As they come our way and they get passed by both houses and come this way, we will issue statements of administration policy. At this time, they are not at that position.  So thank you, guys, very much. We'll see you tomorrow with the Prime Minister. Take care. Q: On Mar-a-Lago -- Q: One question. Q: Come back. MR. SPICER: Sorry, one quick one. On Mar-a-Lago, someone asked about it yesterday, so a quick follow-up. The President has offered as a gift to the Prime Minister, he will be his guest at Mar-a-Lago. No one else will be staying there, as far as I know, from the Japanese delegation. They will stay out in town with the rest of the staff. But that is a gift that the President is extending to the Prime Minister. Thank you, guys. END 2:26 P.M. EST"
Donald J. Trump: Background Press Call by Senior Administration Officials on Prime Minister Abe's Visit to the White House,2017-02-09,"12:04 P.M. EST SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Hi. Today's briefing will be on background. You may quote the official as a senior administration official. With that, I will turn it over to our senior administration official. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Great. Thanks, and hi, everyone. So just before we get started with Q and A, I'll just say a couple words. I think that in the first few weeks of the Trump administration, you can see the importance that President Trump has placed on our alliances in the Asia Pacific. Alliances, in his view, are central to our security and prosperity. At the end of the day, America is great because of our alliances, and the U.S. recognizes that we have tremendous interests across the region. The President has already spoken to several of his counterparts across the region, including Japan and Korea, Australia and New Zealand.  I joined Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis on his first trip as Secretary of Defense to Korea, as well as to Japan last week, and Secretary Mattis' words and deeds, I think, really went a long way toward reassuring our allies that we stand with them, shoulder to shoulder, 100 percent, and that we're seeking to strengthen what are already longstanding and major and important alliances.  So it's really in that light that Prime Minister Abe is visiting, arriving tonight in Washington for a visit that's going to stretch into the weekend. He is only the second head of state to visit President Trump since his inauguration. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Minor clarification. Minor clarification. Wouldn't he be more properly described as a head of government? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you -- because of the emperor. So, and he is also -- or is it because of the Queen actually, in the UK? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, right, exactly. And Theresa May is head of government and -- right. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I hear you. So it's not the first time that he's met Prime Minister Abe. Prime Minister Abe was the first leader to (inaudible) President Trump after the election. They've had already a number of conversations, and I think that that really makes clear the importance that the President is placing on that relationship and on the U.S. role in the Asia Pacific region. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: All right, are you ready for questions? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay. Let's open it up. Q: Hello? Hey, sorry, the operator was talking, I couldn't hear. It's Margaret Talev with Bloomberg. Thanks for doing the call. First of all, just hoping you can walk us through his schedule. What time is the news conference? What's happening tomorrow versus Saturday, yadda yadda? I also am wondering if you can address -- do you expect any deliverables and/or any reportable developments on nuclear power, on high-speed rail, or on anything bilateral trade-ish, TPP-ish? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Right, okay. So I think you're going to get the precise schedule through my colleague's office. So I'm not going to go into extreme detail just out of fear of giving you bad -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: To clarify that, you'll get it through main press.  SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: But just some of the highlights -- the Prime Minister and his delegation are going to meet with President Trump in the Oval Office tomorrow. They are going to have a conversation that's going to cover a very wide range of subjects dealing with the bilateral relationship, the security piece of the relationship, as well as the economic, and also talking about matters of mutual interest regionally and globally as well. After that, there is going to be a working lunch. It will be a slightly larger grouping of people. And that lunch will probably delve more deeply into the economic piece of the relationship. And from there, the President and the Prime Minister are going to travel down to Palm Beach, where the Prime Minister and his wife will be guests of President Trump for the weekend. And I imagine that there will be a fair bit of golf involved, as well as more time together eating and just relaxing really down at Mar-a-Lago.  Q: News conference? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The second part in terms of deliverables -- I'll leave it to the Japanese to talk in more concrete terms about what might be announced in the way of concrete deliverables on the economic side. But I can tell you that the U.S. and Japan represent together 30 percent of the world's GDP. We share an interest in sustaining a strong global economy, ensuring financial stability, and ensuring job growth in both countries. And Prime Minister Abe is well acquainted with President Trump's priorities, which you could sum up in three words -- jobs, jobs, jobs -- when it comes to the economic relationship.  And so I think that they'll have pretty in-depth discussions about the overall relationship as well as reaffirming the interest in seeing a free and rules-based trading order in the region. But I'll leave it to you and your colleagues in the press to extract from the Japanese any concrete deliverables that might come. Q: My question is about whether the Senkaku Islands will be on the agenda and whether President Trump, given his track record of being willing to break from previous U.S. policy, would be considering taking a different position on the sovereignty of the Senkakus, particularly in light of his effort to create leverage in negotiations with China. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Got it. Brian, good to hear your voice. So on the Senkakus, the standing U.S. policy has been that the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, Article 5 of that treaty does apply to the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which we recognize as being administered by Japan. That certainly is the Trump administration's policy, as well. And I can -- I would expect certainly for you to hear on that subject and in fairly concrete terms that President Trump is committed to that treaty and it extending. We oppose any unilateral actions that would seek to undermine Japan's administration of the islands.  As for the question of sovereignty, that is really something that I would not expect to see addressed in this visit. Q: Thanks for doing the call. I wanted to get a question on color that shapes how Prime Minister Abe became the recipient of this sort of informal summit, the first of this President, how that came about, and whether or not that means that the President will have more sort of unfettered time to talk about issues in a sort of different context than he would in the White House.  And then I didn't hear you address whether there would be a news conference -- to Margaret's question.  And just lastly on the question of trade, kind of dovetailing with what Brian was asking with respect to China, are there things on the agenda that would allow the Trump administration to move forward with the Japanese on any sort of bilateral trade agreement that would supplant TPP? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Got it. Okay, so in terms of color about how this summit came about, I think that it was a natural result of the foundation that was laid before the inauguration with Prime Minister Abe's early visit. And it was the natural result of the President's belief that our alliances are central to our success, both in terms of security and prosperity in the region.  As to whether there will be other meetings that follow a sort of -- a casual format, or what you call ""unfettered"" time together, I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case. The President does have a -- believes in getting to know leaders that he knows he's going to be spending a lot of time dealing with. And on relationships that are important to him, he believes he can get the measure of the people through more informal settings. And so I imagine that he'll make use of time outside of Washington, D.C., with leaders from time to time. As for a news conference, my colleague can confirm, but, yes, there will be a press conference tomorrow after the -- I believe it's after the meeting in the Oval Office.  And on trade discussions, the President I think has made pretty clear that he believes that bilateral agreements are really the way to go for the United States, that in a bilateral agreement you can negotiate terms that are more favorable to the United States than you can negotiate in a multilateral agreement, where sometimes you're held to the standard of the weakest link in the compact. So I'm not going to get ahead of discussions tomorrow to see where discussions go. But I think that this is a first -- it's really a first summit since they've come into office, so they're going to be talking on a pretty wide range of subjects and certainly touching on possible paths forward with relation to the overall economic relationship. But we'll leave it at that. Q: Thank you so much for the call, guys. And thank you for giving me an opportunity to ask a question. What I wanted to ask you is, there is a certain attempt to forge closer ties between Japan and Russia. There has been recently a meeting between President Putin and Prime Minister Abe. And we see a general -- I don't know if I want to use the word rapprochement between the two countries -- well, certainly something like that is taking place. I wanted to ask you -- does the Trump administration have any objections to that? Or do you encourage that? How do you view those bilateral attempts between Russia and Japan? Thank you. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks very much. We certainly understand that Japan, as a neighbor of Russia, puts high importance on its own bilateral relations with Russia. And the United States respects that and isn't seeking to interfere with Prime Minister Abe's priorities in his dealings with Russia. But I'll leave it to Prime Minister Abe and his government to talk in detail about that bilateral relationship. Q: I wanted to ask if you had any specific item that the President is expected to push Prime Minister Abe on. For example, currency manipulation does seem to be a subject of those around him that has been stressed throughout TPP negotiations from the Republican side. Thank you. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, I mean, the President's comments the other day about currency manipulation weren't the first comments he's made about his views on that subject. I think that over the course of a long weekend together, the two leaders are going to cover a pretty broad range of subjects. I don't think that's necessarily a -- I can tell you that's not something that's at the top of the list, but whether it comes up naturally in conversation, we'll see over the course of that meeting. Q: Hi, this is Kyle Cardine from Fuji TV. First, I wanted to ask, yesterday Sean Spicer said he would take the question in regards to who was paying for Prime Minister Abe's visit to Mar-a-Lago. And also we have one more from our bureau chief.  Q: Hi, the President the other day said that Japan is sending hundreds of thousands of cars with big ships, but U.S. cannot sell its cars in Japan. But, in fact, there's no importing tax in Japan, and also the Japanese car manufacturing companies are creating a lot of jobs here in the United States. How do you respond to this kind of Japanese government opinion? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm sorry, the line went a little fuzzy just at the end of your bureau chief's question. I'm sorry, if you could repeat that. Q: My question is, the President said the U.S. cannot sell its own cars in Japan, but, in fact, there's no importing tax in Japan for U.S. cars. And also, the Japanese car manufacturing companies are creating a lot of jobs here in the United States because they are producing most of the cars in the U.S. How do you respond to this kind of Japanese government opinion? Thank you. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Right. Okay, so on who's paying for the visit, I'd defer to Sean Spicer to get back to you on that, since I'm not directly involved with the logistics. I'm sure that whatever arrangement was made -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can address that. The visit to Mar-a-Lago is a personal gift of -- I don't know exactly how we're phrasing it, but it's something that the President is doing for the Prime Minister. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Got it. And on your second one, I would really -- what I'd like to do is defer to my colleague who's actually working on the economic piece in more detail than I am on this visit. And he's not on the line, so my excuse to dodge the question -- the import tax. But automobiles is certainly going to be an important topic of conversation in both directions, because it's such an iconic and critical part of the Japanese economy. It's of high interest to President Trump. And I'm sure that that will come up in discussion. Q: Hey, it's Olivier Knox at Yahoo! News. I have a couple for you. The first one is, unless I missed it, the President has not yet spoken to Xi Jinping. Is there, beyond the sort of symbolic importance of this, are you sending a deliberate message by doing that? And then, specifically for you, what's the President's position in terms of North Korea in terms of a six-party-like approach or unilateral pressure? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So in terms of -- you're right that the President Trump has not spoken with President Xi Jinping. The two have exchanged letters. Xi Jinping had sent a congratulatory letter on the day of the President's inauguration. And President Trump yesterday sent a letter to Xi Jinping really to wish President Xi and the people of China a happy Lantern Festival -- the Lantern Festival is on Saturday. I recommend you going and getting those soup dumplings somewhere in the D.C. area -- (laughter) -- which is fun to do. And, of course, a prosperous and healthy year of the rooster, as well.  The President, in his note to Xi Jinping, stated that he believes that having a constructive relationship with China would be something that would serve the fundamental interests of both of our countries and really the region in the world more widely, and that he does look forward to discussing matters of mutual cooperation, as well as delving into some of the well-known differences in the relationship. So they are in contact. To your second question about six-party talks and the like, I'd say that it's right now premature to detail a North Korea strategy on the part of the Trump administration. And in time we'll have more that we'll be prepared to say about that. Japan and the United States both strongly urge North Korea not to take provocative acts. And, of course, were they to do so, that would be information that would feed into and inform a Trump administration approach to the DPRK. Q: The Japanese I've spoken with since the campaign have obviously been quite nervous about some of the rhetoric that they heard from the President back on the campaign trail about paying more for the bases and wouldn't mind perhaps if Japan and South Korea built their own nuclear weapons. What is -- how is the President going to assure Prime Minister Abe that the United States truly has its back and that there's no need for the Japanese to worry that the United States isn't going to be there for its defense? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. I think the way he'll do it is both in words and in actions, and those words and actions are already taking place.  Secretary of Defense Mattis, who the President had asked to visit the region, made very clear statements about the strength of the alliance, that these alliances and our commitment to them are unwavering and really the cornerstone of prosperity, security and freedom in the Asia Pacific region. So I think that you're going to hear similar messages from the President himself. And I think that that will go a long way towards dispelling any doubts that may still remain, or Japanese and Korean and friends and other friends and allies throughout the region. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay. Thank you for doing that. Thanks, everybody, for joining. We appreciate it.  END 12:30 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-02-14,"1:15 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Good afternoon. Happy Valentine's Day. I can sense the love in the room. (Laughter.)  First off, last night, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control -- OFAC -- labeled the Venezuelan Vice President as a specially designated narcotics trafficker under the Kingpin Act.  Before I continue with the briefing and look forward to your questions, I want to turn it over for a short time to newly minted Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, to issue a brief statement on this and deliver a few questions. Secretary Mnuchin. SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Pleasure to be here on my first busy day in office. Yesterday, the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control, known as OFAC, designated Venezuelan national Tareck El Aissami as a specially designated narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for playing a significant role in international narcotics trafficking. El Aissami's primary frontman, Venezuelan national Samark Lopez Bellow was also designated. These designations follow a multi-year investigation into El Aissami's criminal activities. And President Trump appreciates the hard work put into this case by the Department of Treasury, the Department of State, as well as the National Security Council and many people throughout law enforcement. Following the signing of the executive order last week designing to break the back of criminal drug cartels, this action demonstrates the President's seriousness about fighting the scourge of drugs in the United States. In addition, he wants to send a clear message to the people of Venezuela that America stands with them.  And with that, I'm happy to take two or three questions specifically about this. Q: Secretary Mnuchin, since sanctions are directly relevant, obviously, to the Treasury Department, which is an agency that you now oversee, can you talk a little bit about plans to sanction Russia and if you'll keep Obama-era sanctions against Russia? SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Our current sanctions programs are in place, and I would say sanctions are an important tool that we will continue to look at for various different countries. But it's a very important program within the Treasury Department. Q: And for Russia specifically? SECRETARY MNUCHIN: The existing policies are in place. Q: Mr. Secretary, are you contemplating any additional sanctions against Iran? And can you tell us what you think the bottom line will be at these particular sanctions you announced yesterday and are referring to today with the Venezuelan Vice President? What's it going to mean? SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, first, let me just comment -- again, this is as a result of a very long effort --  Q: Did you (inaudible) the implication, by the way? SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yes, this was underway. This was a very long effort. But the implication is quite significant. We expect that there will be frozen tens of millions of dollars and, again, that sanctions are a very important way of us sending a message that we will not stand for illicit activities, whether they're drug trafficking or terrorism.  Q: On Iran, sir? Q: Secretary, including sanctions, what other tools are you looking at? SECRETARY MNUCHIN: I can't comment on all the tools, but, again, let me just reinforce that sanctions are a very important tool within the department and we will use them as appropriate.  Q: What about freezing assets? SECRETARY MNUCHIN: In this case, we did freeze assets -- again, as I mentioned, tens of millions of dollars of assets. And that will have a very big impact on this. So I'll take one more question please. Yes, in the back. Q: During the campaign, the President had made comments about Janet Yellen and whether -- basically inferring that she was being too political and that she should be ashamed of herself. Do the folks at the Treasury Department and within the administration feel confident with Mrs. Yellen at the helm and to be able to set monetary policy going forward? SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, let me just comment. I'm really here today, again, to talk about the Venezuelan situation. But let me just say that there is a tradition of the Secretary of Treasury having ongoing meetings with the head of the Federal Reserve, and I look forward to that now that I'm in office doing that and spending time with her. Thank you very much, everybody. It's a pleasure to be here on my first day.  MR. SPICER: All right, let's get back to the fun. We've been reviewing -- and I want to address the events of last night, first and foremost. We've been reviewing and evaluating this issue with respect to General Flynn on a daily basis for a few weeks, trying to ascertain the truth. We got to a point not based on a legal issue, but based on a trust issue, where a level of trust between the President and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change. The President was very concerned that General Flynn had misled the Vice President and others. He was also very concerned in light of sensitive subjects dealt with by that position of national security advisors -- like China, North Korea and the Middle East -- that the President must have complete and unwavering trust for the person in that position. The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable instances is what led the President to ask for General Flynn's resignation. Immediately after the Department of Justice notified the White House Counsel of the situation, the White House Counsel briefed the President and a small group of senior advisors. The White House Counsel reviewed and determined that there is not a legal issue, but rather a trust issue. During this process it's important to note that the President did not have his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, who he trusts immensely, approved by the Senate. When the President heard the information as presented by White House Counsel, he instinctively thought that General Flynn did not do anything wrong, and the White House Counsel's review corroborated that. It is not ordinary* [unordinary] for an incoming National Security Advisor to speak with his counterparts about the issues of concern to them. In fact, he spoke with over 30 of his counterparts throughout the transition. As Charles Krauthammer said last night, it is ""perfectly reasonable for him to do so."" The issue here was that the President got to the point where General Flynn's relationship -- misleading the Vice President and others, or the possibility that he had forgotten critical details of this important conversation had created a critical mass and an unsustainable situation. That's why the President decided to ask for his resignation, and he got it. The irony of this entire situation is that the President has been incredibly tough on Russia. He continues to raise the issue of Crimea, which the previous administration had allowed to be seized by Russia. His Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, stood before the U.N. Security Council on her first day and strongly denounced the Russian occupation of Crimea. As Ambassador Haley said at the time, the ""dire situation in Eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions.""  President Trump has made it very clear that he expects the Russian government to deescalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea. At the same time, he fully expects to and wants to be able to get along with Russia, unlike previous administrations, so that we can solve many problems together facing the world, such as the threat of ISIS and terrorism. The President is currently evaluating a group of very strong candidates that will be considered to fill the National Security Advisor position permanently, and is confident in the ability of General Kellogg, a decorated and distinguished veteran of the United States Army, until that person is ultimately chosen. Before I get into the President's schedule for today, a quick recap of the President's activity over the last few days, since we haven't had the honor of spending so much time together. The President has been keeping a close eye on the Oroville Dam situation in California. We've worked closely with Doug LaMalfa, who represents California's First District, where the dam is located, and other state officials to help people who have been impacted. The situation is a textbook example of why we need to pursue a major infrastructure package in Congress. Dams, bridges, roads, and all ports around the county have fallen into disrepair. In order to prevent the next disaster, we will pursue the President's vision for an overhaul of our nation's crumbling infrastructure. We hope everyone remains safe as the evacuations continue, and we'll be working alongside with FEMA and appropriate government entities to make sure that we are doing everything we can to attend to this matter.  The President was honored also to welcome the Prime Minister of Japan last week from their first official meeting at the White House to their joint press conference at Mar-a-Lago -- excuse me, their joint press conference and their time together at Mar-a-Lago. The President and the Prime Minister had a productive visit that reaffirmed their determination to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance and economic relationship. At Mar-a-Lago, the President was proud to stand behind Prime Minister Abe on Saturday to convey the United States' unwavering support for our Japanese allies in the face of North Korea's most recent missile launch. On Sunday, the President met with now-Secretary of Treasury Mnuchin and Mr. Steve Wynn before returning to Washington. Yesterday, the President had an incredibly productive set of meetings and discussions with Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada, focusing on our shared commitment to close cooperation in addressing both the challenges facing our two countries and the problems throughout the world. Our countries share a profound economic interest with more than $2 billion in two-way trade flowing across our border every day.  The President was pleased to launch the Canada-United States Council for the Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders by holding a roundtable discussion here at the White House. Together with Prime Minister Trudeau, his daughter Ivanka, the President discussed the unique challenges that women face in the workplace with an incredible group of successful and respected female business executives from both countries. A full list of the participants is available through the pool. In addition to his in-person meetings with the prime ministers of Japan and Canada, the President also recently had phone calls with the presidents of Tunisia, Peru, Nigeria, Colombia and South Africa. Readouts are available on all of those calls. Finally, following the Prime Minister's visit yesterday, the President met with Chairwoman McDaniel and Co-Chairman Paduchik of the Republican National Committee. In the afternoon, the President participated in a pinning ceremony for Major Ricardo Turner, one of his military aides. The aides to the President are mid-grade officers, one from of each of the services. They provide direct support to the President in his role as Commander-in-Chief, and their primary responsibilities are to serve as an emergency action officer, aide-de-camp, and ceremonial aide. It's a longstanding tradition that when the President's military aide is promoted to the next higher grade, the President conducts that promotion. Major Ricardo Turner, the President's military aide, was recently promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, and the promotion was held in the Oval Office. The President also spoke yesterday with Maureen Scalia on the one-year anniversary of her husband's passing. The President and Mrs. Scalia discussed her late husband's incredible legacy, and how the President is making every effort to carry it on by nominating Judge Gorsuch, who shares the love of the Constitution, to succeed him on the bench. Last night, the President obviously hosted the swearing-in of Secretary Mnuchin in the Oval Office. Secretary Mnuchin is a world-class financier whose decades of experience with financial and monetary matters make him the ideal person to spearhead the President's plan to develop a dynamic, booming economy that works for all Americans. We're glad to officially have him on board. Now, moving on to the schedule for today -- this morning, the President and newly confirmed Secretary of Education DeVos held a parent-teacher conference meeting with parents and educators from public, private, charter, and home schools this morning. The President opened the meeting by congratulating Secretary DeVos for her toughness and staying the course throughout her confirmation process. He then discussed his vision for all Americans to have an opportunity to climb the ladder of success, starting with making quality education available to every child no matter their zip code. Under the current system, the President believes too many of our children are trapped in failing schools, especially in the African American community. The President told the group to begin addressing this problem, which he views as a civil rights issue. He wants parents to be able to decide what educational options are best for their children. The group launched into a wide-ranging discussion that included public and charter schools, home-schooling, dropout prevention, and the BASIS Schools Program, states' responsibilities, and the current state of the U.S. Department of Education. The President's ultimate goal is to create safe communities, great schools, and well-paying jobs. He believes that each of these goals is linked to the others, and the Trump administration is taking concrete steps to achieve them all. The President also spoke on the phone earlier today with Prime Minister May of the United Kingdom, continuing the productive conversation they started during her visit earlier this year. A readout on that call should be coming soon. The President then had lunch with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and his wife regarding combatting drug use. At 2:00, the President will sign House Joint Resolution 41 in the Oval Office. The resolution is a start of rolling back harmful Obama-era regulations, which have cost the American business consumers a staggering $890 billion, making our companies less competitive and even driving some of them out of business. The American free enterprise system is the greatest engine for economic prosperity in the world, but for too many, to reach its maximum potential, we must remove the barriers to productivity that are holding back our great workers and businesses.  Misguided federal regulations, such as the SEC rule addressed by HJR 41, inflict real cost on the American people and put our businesses, especially small businesses, at a significant disadvantage. It's a priority for the Trump administration to fix our broken regulatory system so that it enhances American productivity and wellbeing without imposing unnecessary costs and burdens. Signing this joint resolution is one more step towards achieving this goal.  Later this evening, the President will meet with Secretary Kelly and Attorney General Sessions to continue discussions on potential options for addressing the very clear national security threats we're facing in light of the recent Supreme Court ruling. Tomorrow, the President is pleased to be welcoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House. They will discuss ways to advance and strengthen the special relationship between our two countries and stability in the Middle East. They will consult on a range of issues -- regional issues -- including addressing the threats posed by Iran and its proxies, the crisis in Syria, and countering ISIS and other terrorist groups.  As the President has made clear, his administration will work to achieve comprehensive agreement that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so that Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and security. The way forward toward that goal will also be discussed between the President and the Prime Minister. They will hold a joint press conference tomorrow, as well, and further guidance will be coming on the time and location.  Looking ahead to Friday, the President will travel to Charleston, South Carolina, to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner. This visit will give the President an opportunity to celebrate a huge milestone for thousands of workers at Boeing, America's number-one exporter and the millions of American workers involved in aerospace. This trip has been months in the making, and we're thrilled to celebrate the rollout of this amazing plane. With that, I'd be glad to take some of your questions.  Jonathan Karl. Q: Back in January, the President said that nobody in his campaign had been in touch with the Russians. Now, today, can you still say definitively that nobody on the Trump campaign, not even General Flynn, had any contact with the Russians before the election? MR. SPICER: My understanding is that what General Flynn has now expressed is that during the transition period -- well, we were very clear that during the transition period, he did speak with the ambassador --  Q: I'm talking about during the campaign. MR. SPICER: I don't have any -- there's nothing that would conclude me -- that anything different has changed with respect to that time period. Q: And why would the President -- if he was notified 17 days ago that Flynn had misled the Vice President, other officials here, and that he was a potential threat to blackmail by the Russians, why would he be kept on for almost three weeks? MR. SPICER: Well, that's not -- that assumes a lot of things that are not true. The President was informed of this. He asked the White House Counsel to review the situation. The first matter was whether there was a legal issue. We had to review whether there was a legal issue, which the White House Counsel concluded there was not, as I stated in my comments. This was an act of trust. Whether or not he actually misled the Vice President was the issue, and that was ultimately what led to the President asking for and accepting the resignation of General Flynn. That's it, pure and simple. It was a matter of trust.  We went through a very deliberative process, a very thorough review. The first part of it was clearly to understand the legal aspect of this, and that was simply concluded there was no legal aspect. And then what happened is the President evaluated the trust aspect of it. Major. Q: When the President was asked on Air Force One yesterday -- I mean, on Friday, rather, traveling down to Mar-a-Lago, about reports about conversations with the Russians about sanctions, he said, ""I don't know about it. I'll look into that."" Was he being truthful?  MR. SPICER: What he was asked specifically is was he aware of a Washington Post story. He hadn't seen that at the time. Of course, he was involved; I just said that he was aware of the situation right after the White House Counsel informed him back in January. Q: And his inquiry to the White House Counsel was strictly about the legalities involved, not the propriety of the conversations between General Flynn and the Russian ambassador?  MR. SPICER: Well, initially, just to be --  Q: Do you have any criticism of the merits of those conversations about sanctions before the Trump administration had been inaugurated? MR. SPICER: So just to be clear, the acting Attorney General informed the White House Counsel that they wanted to give a ""heads up"" to us on some comments that may have seemed in conflict with what he had sent the Vice President out in particular. The White House Counsel informed the President immediately. The President asked him to conduct a review of whether there was a legal situation there. That was immediately determined that there wasn't. That was what the President believed at the time, from what he had been told, and he was proved to be correct. The issue, pure and simple, came down to a matter of trust. And the President concluded that he no longer had the trust of his national security advisor over -- Q: But was it proper for the incoming national security advisor, not part of an administration, to be discussing an issue as sensitive as sanctions with the Russian ambassador? MR. SPICER: His job is to discuss issues with his counterparts. I mean, Charles Krauthammer put it perfectly last night -- that's what he's supposed to be doing. I mean, that's his job. We would constantly read out throughout the transition who he was speaking to, how he was getting ready. The President was receiving congratulatory calls from around the world. We would read out the world leader calls.  The job of the incoming NSA is to sit down with the counterparts and start that dialogue, and that's exactly what he did. So the question wasn't did he do anything improper or legal, it's a question of could he be trusted further. And that trust, or the erosion of that trust, was, frankly, the issue. Q: Did the President instruct him to talk about sanctions with the Russian ambassador? MR. SPICER: No, absolutely not. No, no, no. But that -- no. And there's no -- that's never -- Q: So would he have preferred he had not done that? MR. SPICER: Look, I think the President had no problem with the fact that he acted in accord with what his job was supposed to be doing. He had an ability to talk about issues that were important, whether it was that or the 30 other countries that he spoke to. That was part of his job, as has been noted by many people. That's what the national security advisor and, frankly, other positions do -- they begin the process of preparing their incoming job by talking to counterparts, people who have previously held the job, et cetera. If he had not done that, there would be questions as to whether he's properly prepared on day one.  Q: So he (inaudible) one conversation about sanctions. MR. SPICER: No, the issue isn't whether or not -- what he discussed. There's been a complete legal review of that, and there's no issue with that. The issue is whether or not he failed to properly inform the Vice President -- or not be honest with him, or not remember it.  But that's the plain and simple issue. And when he lost trust with the President, that's when the President asked for and received his resignation. Q: Thanks a lot, Sean. Yesterday, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the President, said that the President continued to have trust in General Flynn.  MR. SPICER: Right. Q: What happened between yesterday morning and yesterday evening that led the President to lose confidence in General Flynn? MR. SPICER: Well, I'm not going to get into the specifics of what the President's thinking was, but I will just say, as I noted in the opening statement, that it was an evolving and eroding process.  And so at the end of the day, the President made a decision, as he does on all subjects, and asked for and received the national security advisor's -- but he is one of those people that we've noted before -- when he is ready to make a decision, he makes it, whether it's hiring somebody or asking for someone's resignation. Once he has determined that he's made a decision on any subject, that's when he informs his staff. So going into the day, it was an evolving situation. He made a determination late in the day, and he executed on it. Yes, Alexis. Q: He's an extremely loyal person, General Flynn. Was it a difficult decision for the President to let General Flynn go? MR. SPICER: Well, sure. I mean, General Flynn is a dedicated public servant. He's headed the DIA, he has been an outstanding member of the Army, both as an officer and then as a flag officer. He's served this country admirably. And I think the President appreciated his service to his nation, his commitment to his campaign, and his service to this country so far. But at some point, the decision came down on whether or not that that trust had eroded. The important matters, as I mentioned, that are before the President when he's dealing with issues of world matters, of all of the issues -- friends and allies, foes, hot spots -- he needs to rely on a national security advisor to give him sage advice. And I think at a certain point, that guidance, that trust, eroded. And the President, as he does on all matters, ultimately decides that when he's ready to make a decision, he executes. Alexis. Q: Sean, two questions. Does the President believe that anything that he discussed with General Flynn during the transition might have been construed by the General as a request or an encouragement to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador? That's question number one. MR. SPICER: So -- oh, we're going to pause. So, on the first, again, as I made clear, there's nothing that the General did that was a violation of any sort. He was well within his duties to discuss issues of common concern between the two countries. I will say it again: What this came down to is a matter of trust. The President was glad that he was out there conducting his job, preparing for his job, going back and forth with his counterparts throughout the world, much as the President had done with all of these world leaders calling the President, congratulating him, looking to set up calls for him once he was inaugurated.  Similarly, General Flynn was beginning that process with his counterparts throughout the world. That was never of a concern to the President, from day one that he was briefed from the White House Counsel. The issue, plain and simple, came down to a matter of trust. And once that occurred, it was over. Q: On question number one, just to clarify, the President does not believe that any discussion that might have taken place -- and we know from intel, it did, on sanctions -- creates a problem for the President in any way -- that that is not a problem, that General Flynn discussed sanctions with the Russians? MR. SPICER: No, there is -- I can't say it clearly enough. There was nothing in what General Flynn did, in terms of conducting himself, that was an issue. What it came down to, plain and simple, was him misleading the Vice President and others, and not having a firm grasp on his recollection of that. That's it. Q: Question number two. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill from both sides of the aisle would like to investigate or probe or ask more questions about this. Does the President hope to cooperate with those investigations? Would he instruct members of his staff who worked for him here and in the administration to cooperate with those investigations? MR. SPICER: Well, we're going to comply with the law. I think the President feels very confident the review that was conducted by White House Counsel was very thorough and concluded very conclusively, as he had first come to -- instinctively come to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong. So people are free to do what they wish, but I think that they will find exactly what the President first believed and what the White House Counsel concluded. And, frankly, I believe a couple publications even reported that there was no investigation for a reason -- because there was not an issue of law, it was an issue of trust. George. Q: When do you expect to have a replacement in place? And secondly, on another topic, there was a report yesterday that one of your colleagues said the White House is keeping dossiers on reporters. Can you say if that's true or not? MR. SPICER: That is absolutely not true. There are no dossiers being kept. It's just a binder that I put right here, that's about it. That was a joke. Hold on one second. And then, I'm sorry, George, the first part? Q: Timetable on a replacement. MR. SPICER: Just like the way he handled this situation, the President will meet with individuals, and when he's ready to make a decision and he feels as though the person is qualified and can properly advise him on the issue, he'll make that decision. But that, as all decisions, rests with him. I'm just going to go to my first Skype seat. John Huck of WKVVU out of Las Vegas. John. Q: Thank you so much on behalf of our viewers here in Southern Nevada for the opportunity to join you today. As you know, Sean, Las Vegas has suffered terribly in the last recession -- more so than perhaps any other city in the country. As the administration moves forward with repealing financial regulations and possibly rolling back Dodd-Frank, what guarantees can you make to Nevadans that those actions won't lead banks and investments banks to re-engage with the risky financial behaviors that tanked our economy the last time and left taxpayers here on the hook to bail those banks out? MR. SPICER: Thanks, John. I think one of the things -- if you look at the intent of Dodd-Frank, it was to make sure that we didn't have institutions that were too big to fail. And frankly, it has actually created institutions that are now too big to fail. Dodd-Frank actually did exactly the opposite of what it intended to do. And I think when you look at the regulation HJR 41 that the President is signing today, this is another example of the President taking decisive action to roll back regulations that are, frankly, creating more of a burden on our nation's banks and businesses than helping them. I think the President is going to be very clear with making sure that we do things that build up the goal of what Dodd-Frank actually intended to do. But right now, we actually, through Dodd-Frank, put taxpayers more on the hook than we let them off. We've created more institutions and created more guarantees for the federal government to bail out some of these institutions if they exceed their authority. John Roberts. Q: Let me go back to what you said at the beginning. You said the White House Counsel's Office reviewed this and determined that there was nothing illegal. What evidence did they look at in making this determination? And secondly, Democrats up on the Hill say that they want an investigation of this. They're looking into what did the President know and when did he know it. So can you tell us what evidence you looked at the White House Counsel's Office, and what did the President know about all of this and when was he aware of it? MR. SPICER: Well, as I mentioned, the first day that the Department of Justice made White House Counsel available -- or sought to notify White House Counsel was January 26th. The President was immediately informed of the situation. As I said, based on the information that was provided at the time, the view was that this was not a violation. He was proved instinctively correct. And White House Counsel at that time undertook an extensive review both of materials and questioning -- Q: Did they -- MR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into the specifics. What I will tell you is, on multiple occasions they had an exhaustive and extensive questioning of General Flynn on several occasions based on information that was provided to them, or materials that were provided to them to review. I'm not going to get into the details of that, but I will just say that there was an exhaustive review.  And again, the thing that's important to note is the Vice President and myself -- in fact, I think the first time I brought this issue up was January 13 -- the Department of Justice didn't notify the White House or the White House Counsel at that time in the transition phase until 13 days later.  So I think it's important to understand something very, very important: This idea of why did it take so long -- I think the first question should be, where was the Department of Justice in this. They were aware of this. We were making statements based on what General Flynn was telling us, starting on January 13th. The Vice President went out on the 15th, right? They didn't notify the White House Counsel's Office until January 26th. At that time, there was an immediate -- the President was immediately informed of that and then asked the White House Counsel to conduct a very, very thorough review. The first part of that review was focused on whether or not there was any legal issue -- that's it. Once that became the issue, then there was a -- it shifted into phase two, which is whether or not there was trust still maintained. Then that became a separate set of issues that were -- Q: I understand. I'm speaking to the actual evidence, that the FBI has transcripts of these intercepts, which I assume were done by the NSA via a FISA Court order. Was there any communication between the White House Counsel's Office and the FBI? Did those transcripts ever enter -- MR. SPICER: I will say that obviously -- there was obviously communication between the Department of Justice and the White House Counsel's Office. I'm not going to get into the specific nature of that. I think it would be inappropriate because of the nature of the information that was being discussed. Yes. Q: Why not dismiss the General on January 27th? Why, if the question was of trust, and immediately you have on the 15th, he's on ""Face the Nation"" saying that -- the Vice President on ""Face the Nation"" saying that this is what General Flynn told me, and then January 26th you hear the opposite -- why not immediately act? Why wait another two and a half weeks? MR. SPICER: I don't understand how that's a due process. Because what the -- the Attorney General didn't come -- the Acting Attorney General -- come in and say that there was an issue. She said, we wanted to give you a head's up that there may be information, okay? She could not confirm there was an investigation. And so it would be unbelievably short-sighted and wrong to go in and dismiss someone immediately. In fact, what the President did was take decisive action to make sure that the White House Counsel thoroughly reviewed and vetted the situation. He took immediate, decisive action. And if you look at the timeline in terms of what he did and how that expanded, the White House Counsel's first and foremost goal was to make sure that there was not a legal issue at hand. Once that was concluded, then it became a phase of determining whether or not the General's action on this and a whole host of other issues undermined his trust in the President. But the President, from day one, from minute one, was unbelievably decisive in asking for and demanding that his White House Counsel and their team review the situation, first and foremost, to question whether it's a legal issue. And what they immediately determined -- not immediately, but within several days, was that, after review, that there was not a legal issue, and then it moved into a second phase. Mara. Q: So wait -- because the President tweeted this morning that the real story is leaks -- illegal leaks. MR. SPICER: It is leaks. But if you think about this -- understand that all of this information was leaked. I mean, I got to -- and again, I know we've got me lecturing you about what the story should be, but I think that there's a real story here. The idea that not just in this administration, but the Obama administration going back to the Bush administration and back, that we have an issue where classified information, of which this would be, is handled in such a way that it is being given out.  And I know in some cases it's a good story, and I understand that, and that's to some degree your responsibility to write that. But I think there's also a story here, with the amount of leaks that are coming out of people that are entrusted with national security secrets and classified information are leaking it out. That's a real concern for this President; that when he's talking on the phone with a world leader, that when he's making key decisions that are in the interest of protecting this country, that we have to wonder whether or not people who work for our government, who are entrusted with classified information and decision-based materials are leaking that information out. That, I do believe, is a big story that should be reported. I also believe that the President is, rightly so, very, very concerned about this, because it's not just something that is plaguing the current situation, but it goes back through the Obama administration, the Bush administration, the Clinton administration. When we have government employees that are entrusted with this and then leak it out, that undermines our national security, frankly. Trey. Q: Hold on -- MR. SPICER: Sorry, I apologize, Mara. Q: I know you just forgot. I have a question, but I want you to clarify something you just said to John. Are you saying that no one has read the transcripts of the calls, or you just don't want to tell us whether they --  MR. SPICER: I said that I'm not going to comment on it. Q: Okay. So my question is about sanctions. You were very specific in talking about the sanctions against Crimea and that he doesn't want to lift them until Crimea is returned. But the sanctions that Flynn was discussing were the sanctions for the election hacking. MR. SPICER: Right. Q: That's something the President could remove on his own if he wanted to. Is he committed to keeping those? MR. SPICER: I think Secretary Mnuchin commented on that. There's no change in our current sanctions strategy with Russia, and I've got nothing for you on that. Trey. Q: Given that the current story is leaks, what is the President willing to do to investigate further to determine where these leaks are coming from? MR. SPICER: Yeah, again, I think this goes back to the same way he negotiates. Telling people what we're going to do to cover up additional leaks wouldn't be a very sound strategy when it comes to making sure that that doesn't happen again. The President has been very clear, whether he's negotiating or dealing with an issue like this, you don't telegraph to people how you're going to handle it. Q: Sean -- MR. SPICER: Hold on, Trey gets a follow-up. Everyone else got one. Q: So he is going to take some sort of steps to investigate these leaks that the administration -- MR. SPICER: I would just say that the President, as I said, is clearly upset about this. He understands the threat that they pose to our national security, and he's going to make sure that he continues to take action to make sure that that stops. Yes. Q: Thank you. So you've mentioned time and time again that this is an issue of trust. You also said that it was an evolving issue, and that the issue of the trust that the President had for Flynn came down to this deception that happened with the Vice President but also a host of whole other -- of other issues. What were the other issues? And was the Vice President the only person that was misled by Flynn? Were other people misled? MR. SPICER: I mean, I think I've stood before you before and explained what General Flynn had conveyed to me. I think there were some others that he had similarly expressed that to, as well. So that's why it's others, because it wasn't just people who went out and made public pronouncements and a series of questioning that was rather exhaustive over a long period of time. He continued to maintain that that had not occurred, and I think that's where the President continued to -- and that's why the President was very clear that it was an eroding issue. Because it was after a series of issues and a series of statements and pronouncements that the President came to that conclusion. Q: Were there other issues outside of this call and the deception over that that led to the mistrust with Flynn? MR. SPICER: I think the statement is very clear that it was this and a series of issues.  With that, let me go to Jason Stevens of the Federalist Paper in Ashland, Ohio. Q: Thank you. What our readers at the Federalist Papers Project are most interested in is returning the country to the first principles of republican government as understood by the American Founders. One of those principles, in the Declaration of Independence, is the consent of the governed. So my question is this: What are the President's future plans for rolling back the expensive and burdensome regulations of the administrative state, most of which are the product of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats who never received the consent of the governed to do anything, let alone make law? MR. SPICER: Thanks, Jason. I think, as I mentioned today, the President, in just a few minutes, is going to be signing HJR 41, which is one of those attempts to roll back some onerous Dodd-Frank regulations with respect to the SEC in particular.  He is going to continue -- last week we rolled out another one of those executive orders that ensures that for every new regulation, two must be gotten rid of. The President's commitment to rolling back regulation and the overreach of government, I think, is unwavering and unquestionable. So you're going to continue to see this President undo a lot of that government overreach. Jim. Q: Yeah, just a quick question. You said earlier in your comments that the President has been incredibly tough on Russia. How is that possible? He has made comment after comment over the course of the campaign, the transition, where he defended Vladimir Putin. He had an interview with Bill O'Reilly where he, when he was asked if Vladimir Putin is a killer, he said, well, America hasn't been that much better in this regard also.  To me it seems, and I think to a lot of Americans it seems that this President has not been tough on Russia. How can you say that? MR. SPICER: Because I just walked through it. I think there's a difference between the President wanting to have an understanding of how a good relationship with Russia can help us defeat ISIS and terrorism throughout the world.  Look, the Obama administration tried to have a reset with Russia. They failed. They tried to tell Russia not to invade Crimea. They failed. This President understands that it's in America's national and economic interests to have a healthy relationship. If he has a great relationship with Putin in Russia, great. If he doesn't, then he'll continue on. But he's not going to just assume that because it wasn't able to happen in the past -- I think you've seen, with Prime Minister Abe in particular and others, that the reset that Prime Minister Netanyahu talked about tomorrow -- so many of these countries from around the globe are looking forward to resetting the relationships that this country has with them; that they feel as though they were abandoned over the last eight years, and that they are excited about the prospect of a new U.S. relationship under a Trump administration. But with respect to Russia, I think the comments that Ambassador Haley made at the U.N. were extremely forceful and very clear that until -- Q: That was an announcement from Haley, not the President. MR. SPICER: She speaks for the President. I speak for the President. All of us in this administration. And so all of the actions and all of the words in this administration are on behalf and at the direction of this President. So I don't think we could be any clearer on the President's commitment. Katie Pavlich. Q: Quick little follow-up, because I haven't had any follow-ups or questions in a while. But anyway -- MR. SPICER: Really? Q: No -- the other question is, just getting back to what was asked a few moments ago about trust and being misled. Are you saying that the national security advisor was intentionally misleading the President, the Vice President, yourself when he made these comments to you about that conversation? MR. SPICER: No, look, the trust is given by the President. It's a relationship between he and any individual. And so, as I mentioned in the comments, maybe it was because -- I don't know that it was intentional, he may have just forgotten, but I think at some point trust isn't just --  Q: Isn't that kind of a weird thing to forget, though, in a conversation where you talk about --  MR. SPICER: But that's the point, Jim, is that at some point that trust eroded to a point where the President did not feel comfortable with him serving in that position, and asked for and received his resignation. Katie Pavlich.  Q: Sean, on the trust issue and the eroding of trust, last night, in General Flynn's resignation letter, he said he inadvertently briefed the Vice President-elect and others with incomplete information. MR. SPICER: Right. Q: Considering his role in advising the President on national security matters, is the White House concerned that he maybe briefed the President-elect, Vice President-elect with incomplete information on other matters of national security in addition to his phone calls with the Russian ambassador? MR. SPICER: Well, when you look at the team, it's not one person in isolation, Katie. It's several. You've got General Kelly on the homeland security front, General Mattis on the DOD front -- he's got an entire national security staff and apparatus that briefs him -- you know, Director Pompeo at the CIA, and others from the DNI's office that come in and brief him on a whole host of issues. So it's not a single position. Q: So was his situation an isolated incident of giving incomplete -- MR. SPICER: Well, yeah. Regardless of whether it's a single situation, it's not as though there's one person briefing him. And the President synthesizes a lot of information, both written and stuff that is briefed to him, and ultimately it is he who makes that decision based a lot on what he already knows, what he is presented with. So the President gets information from a lot of people -- generals, admirals, people in the military community, ambassadors, people in the State Department, an exhaustive team at the National Security Council, and then makes an ultimate decision based on that and what he already knows to be the case. Q: Sean, you've been asked a couple times about these transcripts of calls. Will the White House declassify those and release them? MR. SPICER: Looks, it is inappropriate for me to comment on those at this time. Right now, the focus is on some of the evolving issues that were going around the globe, as you know. Q: Will you be open to it? MR. SPICER: Let me answer the question. It is not an issue that has come up. I think the President right now is focused on replacing his national security advisor, making sure that he's presented with the best possible information to make these key decisions. But at this time, we also have got to be careful that we were not involving ourselves in a matter of national security. And the review, as I mentioned, was done and then immediately last night when the President felt as though it was time for a decision, made it. That's where we are in this iteration of the process. If we have anything further for you, we will update you. I want to go to Joyce Kaufman of WFTL Talk News in Palm Beach, Florida. Q: Thank you so much for this opportunity. I'm approximately six miles away from Mar-a-Lago right now, and the President met with Prime Minister Abe from Japan at Mar-a-Lago this weekend. And besides giving us traffic and security nightmares, there were apparently conversations that took place by telephone and with the Prime Minister that were in a relatively insecure dining area. There is already video of this surfacing. Will there be a SCIF put in place in these dining areas, these public places? And one last question. When he meets with Prime Minister Netanyahu tomorrow, will they be discussing moving the embassy, and settlements? MR. SPICER: On the second one, I'm not going to get ahead of the Prime Minister's discussion with the President. We'll have a readout. After that, there will be a press conference. With respect to the first, there is a SCIF at Mar-a-Lago. And just to be clear, the briefing -- the President was briefed in a SCIF ahead of dinner. He went with his national security team. They briefed him on the situation in North Korea. Subsequently, he had a dinner, of which was attended exclusively by U.S. and Japanese delegation members. At that time, apparently there was a photo taken, which everyone jumped to nefarious conclusions about what may or may not be discussed. There was simply a discussion about press logistics, where to host the event. And then after the dinner, the President went back into the SCIF to get a further update from his team. So I'm not really sure where people jumped to conclusions. There is a SCIF there. It was utilized on two occasions that evening to convey to the President by his national security team the situation in North Korea. And then the President subsequently stood shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese President to make sure that our commitment to their security and stand against North Korea was fully made aware. Margaret. Q: Sean, can you just clarify, because I got a little turned around -- did President Trump, or President-elect Trump at the time, know of General Flynn's discussion of the sanctions while he was NSC-designate? And if not, when did he finally learn about them? And if so, why was he okay with that? MR. SPICER: So, no, he was not aware, as he's not back-briefed on every conversation that his national security team has or other staffers. They were performing their duties, as other people were in terms of getting up to speed, conveying with counterparts and previous members of their team.  That being said, when he was made aware of it, once the White House Counsel briefed him on concerns the Department of Justice had -- and at that point, as I mentioned, what he asked and what he believed at the time and was confirmed by White House Counsel was that there was no legal issue here. Discussing the issue didn't violate anything; it was appropriate in the normal course of action to discuss that. And he immediately asked the White House Counsel to further confirm what his instincts were at the time. Thank you, guys. Have a great one. We've got everybody for a bill signing. We've got a bill signing.  Q: I didn't get my -- MR. SPICER: Oh, he's got -- Margaret gets a follow-up, but he's got -- Q: Are you -- is the administration undertaking any sort of effort, either Cabinet-wide or, like, inside the shop to make sure that everyone comes forward who had any communications with the Russians about sanctions or otherwise? MR. SPICER: There's no other information. I mean, as far as we are aware, that is an isolated incident that occurred. And again, the key point in this isn't that there were discussions. There was nothing wrong or inappropriate about those discussions. It purely came down to a matter of trust. That's it. Thank you, guys. See you tomorrow. Happy Valentine's Day.  END 2:00 P.M. EST"
Donald J. Trump: Press Gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders,2017-02-17,"3:16 P.M. EST MS. SANDERS: I'll read a little bit, give you guys a quick update. Clearly, I'm not Sean, but hopefully you guys will treat me just as nicely as you do him every week.  First, I'd like to say the President was pleased to see that the EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, was confirmed by the Senate today. Administrator Pruitt will be essential in the President's plan to restore the EPA's essential mission of keeping our air and water clean and safe. In this administration, the EPA will no longer spend unnecessary taxpayer dollars on an out-of-control, anti-energy agenda. The President is glad to finally have him officially onboard.  As you know, we just came from Boeing, where the President talked jobs with company executives and celebrated the rollout of the amazing 787-10 Dreamliner. That airplane is an incredible example of what American ingenuity and initiative can create. President Trump is committed to unleashing U.S. businesses so that we can create, imagine, inventive -- and building in this country again. Under the President's ambitious jobs plan, American industry will come roaring back. He's already started ending job-killing regulations and will be working to lower taxes on American businesses, and the results are already on their way. From Intel's incredible announcement last week to automakers keeping and bringing back thousands of jobs, businesses across the country are responding to the President's pro-growth plans. The trip to Boeing is the perfect cap on a week of tremendous progress on the President's economic agenda. And just yesterday, he signed House Joint Resolution 38, nullifying the job-killing stream-protection rule, which went into effect on the very last day of the Obama administration. This rule was just the left again imposing an anti-American energy agenda on the people without considering the significant cost. It took power away from state and local governments in order to grow the federal bureaucracy, ignoring the extremely negative impact it would have on hardworking Americans and their families, and the support by putting upward pressure on energy costs.  President Trump is committed to ending the previous administration's war on coal, which is really a war on our coal miners. An October, 2015 economic analysis by the National Mining Association found that this rule jeopardizes as many as 280,000 jobs. Rolling back this rule is a significant step towards fulfilling the President's promise to restore America's coal-mining industry and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports. The President is bringing back jobs at both the plant and mine level, and the spirit of optimism rising across this country is only going to grow as the President signs more and more bills just like this one.  Just look at the stock market, which hit record numbers this week, due to a surge in optimism in the business world and spurred by anticipation of the President's impending pro-growth agenda. These sentiments were echoed during the President's meeting on Wednesday with a group of CEOs from some of America's largest retailers. The retail sector supports roughly 42 million jobs, according to the National Retail Federal, more than any other sector of the economy. It's also saddled with some of the most burdensome tax and regulations of any industry. President Trump's pro-growth tax and regulatory reform plans will simplify our tax code and lower rates for hardworking Americans and their companies. Retail leaders thank the President for hosting them at the White House and noted that they were optimistic about the future, because no previous President had ever been so willing to hear from them directly on the issues that impact their business and customers. The President pledged to take appropriate action in the executive branch to address their concerns and to work closely with congressional leaders to pass legislation that will help create a dynamic, booming economy that works for all Americans. Tomorrow, the President will be back in front of the people at a rally at the Orlando Melbourne International Airport. Q: Where is it -- the international airport? MS. SANDERS: President Trump, just as he did so effectively throughout the campaign, is going to continue taking his message directly to the American people. I know he's looking forward to being back in Florida, a state that holds a special place in his heart, where the winter White House is, as well as a place that was so instrumental in his historic electoral victory in November.  And with that, I'll take a few of your questions. Q: Sarah, can you talk about the expectations this weekend, in terms of who he's going to meet with to fulfill the role of the national security advisor? MS. SANDERS: We don't have any announcements at this time, but I know that obviously that's something the President takes very seriously, and wants to make sure he's got the right person in the job. Q: Who is he considering? MS. SANDERS: Again, we don't have any announcements or specific details to release at this time. Q: Can you give us a sense of his timetable? We know he had hoped to try to fill this position by today. That's obvious it's not going to happen, but do -- is the expectation within the next two days? MS. SANDERS: I don't know if we have a specific timetable, but if we do, I'll get back to you on it. Q: Are you thinking about redefining the job or changing the job description to make it more appealing, or to make sure that people that it's offered to will take it? MS. SANDERS: Not to my knowledge, but, again, I can check on that. Q: While the President was at Boeing, did he express his commitment to funding the Ex-Im Bank? MS. SANDERS: I don't know if that was specifically addressed. Are you talking about in the private meeting? Q: Yeah. MS. SANDERS: Yeah, I'm not sure if that was specifically addressed. I wasn't in the room for the private meeting. Q: Generally, does he support funding the Ex-Im Bank? MS. SANDERS: You know, I think that's a question that I'll let him answer down the line. Q: Sarah, the President yesterday said that he was going to be reintroducing the executive order -- a different version of the executive order on immigration and refugees. What is the White House doing differently this time around to ensure that the new order could withstand any legal challenge? MS. SANDERS: The President was pretty specific yesterday when he talked about it in terms of that it would match and address the concerns that were part of the legal complications it ran into previously. Q: Are different people involved? Is there a different sign-off process -- anything like that? MS. SANDERS: No, I mean, again, all of the people that needed to know the last time, that would be part of this process, would be involved in this process again. Q: Has the President seen a complete order at this point? MS. SANDERS: I don't know if an order is finalized, but I know they're working on it and expect to have that at the first part of next week. Q: Has he looked at it in progress, or will he wait until it's finalized in its proposed form to take a look at it? MS. SANDERS: I know the President has been involved in the process, but I don't know if he has seen the most up-to-date version. Q: Sarah, can you say if the administration has ever considered having the National Guard help round up undocumented immigrants? MS. SANDERS: The President and the White House have never had that as part of any plan to use the National Guard in any capacity for that. Q: Why did Kelly draft this memo? MS. SANDERS: I'm sorry? Q: Why did Kelly draft this memo if that was never considered? MS. SANDERS: Secretary Kelly?  Q: Yeah. MS. SANDERS: Secretary Kelly did not draft that memo. Q: We're now on day 28 -- Q: Who drafted it then? Wait, who drafted it? MS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of the specific person, but I know that it wasn't Secretary Kelly, or at his direction. Q: We're now -- you know, the President was inaugurated four weeks ago today. Why does he feel the need tomorrow to go back onto the stump? And what should we expect to hear from him tomorrow? MS. SANDERS: I think it's real simple the reason he wants to go back. I think, in large part, it's because his message, when filtered through -- unfortunately, people standing in this circle don't always do the best job delivering his message, and nobody does it better than he does. And so, he can do that very easily by taking the stage and talking directly to the people of America, addressing their concerns, and being able to properly express exactly what he's doing, what his administration has done over the last month, and what they plan to do in the coming weeks. Q: Is this a campaign rally for 2020? Or is it a campaign rally for another candidate? Or how do you portray it?  MS. SANDERS: I think it's most likely a campaign rally for America. I think it's -- again, it's the President's time to be able to speak directly to people across this country in an unfiltered way, and in a way that doesn't have any bias that's been expressed through the reporting that usually happens. Q: But it's being funded by a political organization, not the White House, is that right?  MS. SANDERS: Correct.  Q: Can you explain the funding? Q: Who is paying for the plane tomorrow going to and from the rally? How that's being done? MS. SANDERS: Specifically on the plane I'll have to double-check. I know the rally itself and I guess staging and everything to do with the rally is covered by the campaign. But I'm not sure about the plane specifically. So I'd have to -- Q: So just to clarify, when you say the campaign, this is the campaign for what? MS. SANDERS: Well, President Trump still has a campaign in existence that can help pay for things that aren't specific to the White House.  Q: -- the Donald J. Trump for President, correct?  MS. SANDERS: Yes, that's still fully operational. Q: So that's a 2020 committee, not a 2016 committee? Because that committee is now defunct. MS. SANDERS: I'm not sure if it's officially been transferred over from a 2016 to a 2020 focus. But we can check on that and let you know. Q: With increasing enforcement, that we've see in this administration, if you are not looking into having 100,000 National Guard, I'm curious if you think you have to change the immigration infrastructure at all. Add more judges or -- you've already said you want to add more agents, but with increased enforcement, are you happy with what you have nationally and infrastructure-wise? MS. SANDERS: That's probably a question that those departments -- ICE might be better able to answer whether or not they need additional support. But right now we're just glad that they have the opportunity to actually go out and do their job, something they haven't probably been allowed to do over the past eight years. Q: The President saying that he loves the DACA kids, and a couple have already been swept up in this increased enforcement, will there be anything in terms of -- besides that the President has talked about keeping DACA going or not, that's still up for debate -- will you do anything for the DACA kids who are not swept up in increased enforcement? MS. SANDERS: Look, I think the President addressed that yesterday. He wants to make sure that that's done correctly. Obviously, there's a compassion piece in that. And he's looking at those options and seeing what the best path is on that. Q: Sarah, just to be clear, you don't know who authored the executive order? MS. SANDERS: I don't specifically know who put pen to paper, but I know that it was not Secretary Kelly and it wasn't at his direction. Q: Did it happen during the transition? MS. SANDERS: I'm not aware on the exact timeline of when it happened. But what I do know is that this White House and this President is not and has had no plans in any capacity to use the National Guard to round up people.  Thanks, guys. END 3:27 P.M. EST"
Donald J. Trump: Press Gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders,2017-02-19,"4:23 P.M. EST MS. SANDERS: Seems very formal here. (Laughter.) I'll keep it pretty short today. I'm going to walk through a couple of things and then I'll take some questions. First of all, the President has had an extremely busy day today. He has been in a number of meetings and quite a few calls, and also a lot of staff briefings and other meetings. A couple big ones of note that you would probably find interesting: He did several interviews and in-depth meetings that are still ongoing as of this afternoon, talking to different candidates for the National Security Advisor position. Among those people, as of today, that he met with: McMaster, Bolton, Caslen and Kellogg, and we may have some additional meetings and names tomorrow, and may also meet with a couple of those people again.  There's also an in-depth meeting on Obamacare. Secretary Price, Mulvaney, Chief of Staff Priebus, Bannon, Seema Verma, and quite a few members of the domestic policy staff also were part of that meeting. And they discussed Obamacare repeal-and-replace strategy, and that went on for several hours. He was not there for the entirety of the meeting.  Q: Was everyone at Mar-a-Lago? MS. SANDERS: Yes. Q: They all flew down? MS. SANDERS: Yes.  Q: That was all in Mar-a-Lago? MS. SANDERS: Yes. I do believe that a couple of the people from that group also went over to the golf club, as well, for a brief period of time.  Q: You said he wasn't there for the whole several hours? MS. SANDERS: Correct. Q: But for part -- MS. SANDERS: Correct. And remember I'll get to the questions section here momentarily. He's had several foreign leader calls today, including with the President of Panama, where they talked about U.S. investment and private sector presence. He also did a second foreign leader call with the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, where they talked about terrorism and other security challenges, including foreign fighters being the primary point of focus on those calls. And we'll have more detailed readouts for both of those later this evening. I know there have been quite a few questions about his comments about Sweden last night. I'll address that now as a group so we don't have to have 75 emails to address it. He was talking about rise in crime and recent incidents in general, not referring to a specific issue.  Q: I'm sorry, it's going too fast. Can you just say that again? MS. SANDERS: Sure. He was talking about rise in crime and recent incidents in general, and not referring to a specific incident. As I said earlier, he's going to continue several meetings throughout the evening, including additional meetings with National Security Advisor candidates. And with that, I will take your questions. Q: On Sweden, where did he get the information about the rise in crime? Was it from that Fox segment on Friday night? MS. SANDERS: I believe he may have seen that, but I also know there have been a number of reports of rise in crime and specific incidents that have taken place over the last several weeks. Q: And also, why then did the President specifically say ""last night""? MS. SANDERS: I don't think that was meant to be last night. I think he was just referring to, again, in general. I had a chance to get that clarified, and he wasn't speaking about a specific incident the night before, but about rise in crime in general. Q: So he misspoke? MS. SANDERS: Well, yeah -- I think he was referring to a report he had seen the previous night that spoke specifically to that topic. Q: Was that a report from Fox News? MS. SANDERS: I don't know. Q: Sarah, you said that there may be more interviews tomorrow. Can you tell us who those names would be? MS. SANDERS: Not at this time. We don't have any further details on those yet. Q: And do you have any updates on his timeline for making the decision? MS. SANDERS: I know he hopes to make it soon. I would think in the next few days. Q: Can you clarify whether Ray Odierno is one of the potential candidates? MS. SANDERS: We don't have any further names to release right now. Q: There's been some reporting about a memo signed by Kelly, draft memos on new guidelines for detaining and deporting immigrants. Can you talk at all about those? And is there anything particular in the documents that the White House is objecting to?  MS. SANDERS: Right now those are nothing more than draft memos. There are still a lot of conversations that are taking place. The final documents haven't been completed. And we expect that to happen in the next couple of days, and we'll roll that out at that time. Q: That's on the immigration executive order? MS. SANDERS: Yes. Q: Or is it on the --  MS. SANDERS: Are you talking about the travel EOs? Q: No, I was talking specifically about the guidelines signed by Kelly about deporting illegal immigrants.  MS. SANDERS: Those are also draft EOs, both sets. I know there have been multiple versions floating around.  Q: These are the ones about hiring more enforcement agents.  MS. SANDERS: None of those are final and have not been signed off by the White House. Q: But are they an accurate reflection of where the policy is headed when it rises to the level where the Secretary signs it? MS. SANDERS: Some components are. But again, those haven't even made it to the White House. And so for that to be a final version is just not accurate.  Q: And just to clarify again, that's about -- MS. SANDERS: There's multiple sets of EOs. None of them are final. They are all in draft form. Q: And what EOs can we expect this week? MS. SANDERS: I don't have any specific announcements about it at this time, but I think you can expect the travel EO -- the revised travel immigration one to be in the next couple of days. Q: Can you say a little bit more about the Obamacare meeting -- like, who all was there; specifically how long they met; what exactly they were talking about, and if they were looping in members of Congress or it was just a White House-centric strategy? MS. SANDERS: There weren't members of Congress that were present today. There were a handful of domestic policy advisors from the White House, Secretary Price, Mulvaney. I know several members of senior staff, Chief of Staff Priebus, Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner were all present for that meeting. Q: Can you tell us more what it was? MS. SANDERS: Again, it was primarily a strategy meeting about laying out the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. Q: Any response regarding Senator McCain's comments this morning that he's very concerned about the membership of the National Security Council, specifically Steve Bannon? MS. SANDERS: I'm not going to respond to Senator McCain's comments. Q: When the President is interviewing these candidates for National Security Advisor, how much of this is simply about him vetting the candidates himself, getting a sense of what they bring to the position, versus the candidates seeking assurances about the ability to set their own staff and other aspects of the job? MS. SANDERS: I think we've made it pretty clear that whoever takes this position will have full authority on the staffing component. I know Chief of Staff Priebus addressed that this morning on the Sunday shows. And I don't know if there's anything further in that realm that you want to look for, but in terms of staffing they'll have full authority to make those decisions. Q: And the President indicated to us yesterday that his timeline is in a matter of days. Beyond the interviews that are happening this weekend, is there anything that could happen at the White House? Or could an announcement come before he leaves here? MS. SANDERS: Your speculation on that is probably as good as mine. I think it could be probably anytime in the next couple of days. Q: Sarah, was the President golfing this morning? And who was he golfing with? MS. SANDERS: I know he played a couple of holes this morning, but I'm not going to disclose any of the others that were there. Q: And yesterday as well? MS. SANDERS: I do believe he played a couple of holes yesterday. Q: A couple as in two, or -- MS. SANDERS: I don't think it was a full round, if that's what you're asking. Q: And on the four names you identified, you said some meetings have happened and some additional would be tonight? Would those be repeat? MS. SANDERS: Some are ongoing right now while we're here. Q: Repeat meetings? MS. SANDERS: Not repeat meetings tonight, but they're ongoing as I'm standing here. Q: So this first round of four goes into this evening? MS. SANDERS: Yes, correct.  Q: And just to clarify, they're all face-to-face? MS. SANDERS: Yes. Q: So they're just here at Mar-a-Lago? MS. SANDERS: Yes, correct. Q: Four finalists -- that's it? MS. SANDERS: As of right now. And I said -- remember -- there could be additional names and additional meetings as early as tomorrow. Q: There have been a couple of reports about administration staffers who have been fired or left their jobs after criticizing the President. One was at HUD; I believe it was the chief of staff. And there's another report today about an NSC aide, Craig Deare, who left his job after harsh criticism of Trump. Is it fair to say that -- I mean, are government employees allowed to criticize the President? MS. SANDERS: He was just sent back to his original position, so he wasn't fired. Q: Who -- MS. SANDERS: Craig Deare. Q: More broadly, do government employees need to be concerned that they are not allowed to criticize the President or they can lose their job? MS. SANDERS: Well, I don't think that any person that is there in order to carry out the President's agenda should be against the President's agenda. It seems pretty silly that you would have somebody that's not supportive of what you're trying to accomplish there to carry out that very thing. Q: What about somebody who in the past was against the President's agenda? MS. SANDERS: Again, I think if you don't support the President's agenda, it would be very hard for you to take a position where your very job is to carry out and help him accomplish that agenda. If they're not onboard with specific pieces of his agenda -- for instance, if you didn't want to help create jobs in the way of cutting regulations, then it would be really silly for him to bring you in to be part of like an economic task force. Q: Sarah, is this test contributing to the administration's, so far, so few jobs -- so few Senate-confirmed jobs being nominated for, whether it be deputy secretaries from a number of Cabinet agencies, below dep-sec level? MS. SANDERS: I think one of the biggest problems that we've had is the obstruction by Democrats. It's really hard to put in the secondary staff when you don't have the leader in that office. If you can't confirm a Secretary, you can't really start filling out the second and third positions in a lot of those agencies, and if, by comparison to past administrations, there's not that big of a gap between what we have and what they have at this point in time. Q: But even in terms of -- not in terms of nominees for the secretaries who are confirmed, what's the timeline then? MS. SANDERS: Well, and a lot of those have just been confirmed over the last week. So, again, that's a moving process, and we're continuing to add and grow staff every day. Q: What was the job that Mr. Deare was sent back to? MS. SANDERS: I'll have to double-check, but I have it, I just don't want to tell you the wrong thing. I don't have it right in front of me. Q: Has the President followed Vice President Pence's trip overseas at all? And what's his reaction to his sort of debut on the world stage? MS. SANDERS: He has. And they've spoken several times over the past several days. I know that both the Vice President and the President have talked to each other, as well as their staffs have both talked back and forth, and very happy with how everything is going so far. Q: Can you tell us more about how you would disagree with the President if you're in a position? You said that if a person doesn't agree with his agenda, they shouldn't have a job. But some people I'm sure disagree with certain policies. How does that work? MS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get into the back-and-forth on the variation of disagreement that you might be able to have in order to have a job. I think the broader point here is if you don't support the President's agenda, you shouldn't have a job in the White House. Q: I mean, administration-wide, though, we're talking about. Are you extending that to various department agencies? MS. SANDERS: I'm not extending like a blanket policy here. I just am saying that if you do not support the agenda and you're not there to help carry it through, then you shouldn't be part of the administration.  Q: The report that the immigrant draft EO that's been going around that shows the same seven countries, but exemptions for travelers who already have a visa, is that where that policy is at right now? Is that an accurate reflection of where you guys are going? MS. SANDERS: Again, that's not final. There's still a lot of moving parts there. And until it's final, I don't want to get into the details.  Q: On the NSC, one of the reasons that we were told that Harward didn't want to take the job was the fact that he couldn't bring in all of his own team. MS. SANDERS: That's inaccurate information. Q: In these interviews, are the candidates being told they can bring on their own team? Or are the deputies who are currently there going to stay? MS. SANDERS: I know it's been made clear that they can bring on their own team, and so that's inaccurate information that you have. Q: So the candidates. And how involved is Pence in Trump's interviews and deciding who the NSC director will be? MS. SANDERS: I don't know his specific involvement, but I know that he and the President have spoken about it. Q: Leon Panetta today said that there has been no convening of the National Security Council in the Trump White House. Is that accurate?  MS. SANDERS: Not to my knowledge. I don't believe that's accurate. But I'll double-check and verify that for you. Q: Let me ask you, on a slightly separate topic, we're just looking to confirm a trade story that was in the Wall Street Journal that says the administration is considering changes that would make the trade gap look larger than in past years, and that it would -- one idea would include excluding from the U.S. any exports -- any items imported to the country and then transferring them to another country, like Mexico or Canada. Can you comment on the story? MS. SANDERS: I saw your question on that, and I'm checking it and getting clarification. I'll let you all know once we have it. Q: Can you tell us about last night when the President attended the cancer fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago? We weren't told about it. Can you tell us a little bit about it? MS. SANDERS: He did attend. He and the First Lady were both present at the gala. It's something they've gone to every year, I believe for the last 10 years. They had dinner and then stopped by the event. Q: Who did he talk to and who did he sit with there? Is it true he sat with Prime Minister Mulroney? MS. SANDERS: I think he talked with quite a few people there. I believe there were over 800 attendees, and so I think he talked to quite a few of them. I don't know all the names of each person. Q: Prime Minister Mulroney was at his table, is that right? MS. SANDERS: I know that they did have an exchange. I don't know if they were actually seated together. Q: I know Reince confirmed this morning that the White House was aware of this request from the intelligence committee to preserve documents related to Russia. Can you describe how those efforts are underway already? Is the White House Counsel distributing information to make sure that staff are aware of this and doing their best to preserve the documents? MS. SANDERS: I know that there have been instructions to preserve all documents. But specific to that, I don't have guidance, but I can see if we have something specific for that and let you know. One more question, anybody? Last one. All right, she got in first. Last one. Q: There have been a lot of reports about the number of people who are coming down to Mar-a-Lago to meet with the President, talk with the President. Do taxpayers pay for flying everyone down here, all the NSA candidates and the people he's meeting for for the Obamacare roundtables? And any idea how many people that would be over the last couple of weekends? MS. SANDERS: I don't know the exact number of people that have been here, and I don't have a comment on the specifics of each individual travel. Q: And along the lines of Mar-a-Lago, there's been concern that people who bought membership to the club, which is now $200,000 up front, are getting special access to the President and his staff that other people don't get. What's the administration's response to that? MS. SANDERS: Look, I think this President is extremely accessible to most of America. I think that's why he went out and did a rally last night, why he did a press conference earlier this week, why he comes back on the plane and talks to you guys. I think this is the most accessible President that I've certainly ever seen, and I don't think that that's an issue across the board. I think he is in touch with regular Americans every single day, and, again, is very transparent and accessible across the board. Thanks, guys. Q: Do you have a week ahead, Sarah? MS. SANDERS: Not yet, but I think we will later tonight. Q: And tomorrow, what time is he going back? MS. SANDERS: I don't know yet. I think we're waiting to see some of the meetings that may take place tomorrow. Thanks, guys. END 4:50 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-02-21,"1:42 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. It's been a little while. Hope you missed me. (Laughter.)  Q: You missed us? MR. SPICER: Absolutely. We've got a lot to talk about today, so let's get right to it. First off, I want to acknowledge the tragic plane crash that occurred in Australia that took the lives of five individuals, including four Americans. The President's thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims, and the U.S. embassy and consulate are ready to provide necessary and appropriate assistance. Moving on, the President was honored to announce that Lieutenant General McMaster will be his National Security Advisor. General McMaster served this nation in the United States Army for over three decades, including during Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Desert Storm. The President met with many distinguished and qualified candidates for the position, and as he has said that he will continue to consider many of them for other positions within the administration. He is especially pleased that Lieutenant General Kellogg will stay on as the National Security Council Chief of Staff. The President is proud to welcome General McMaster to the team where he will have full authority to structure the office to his desires to best serve its ultimate mission, which is to protect the American interests at home and abroad. This morning, Secretary Kelly and the Department of Homeland Security released memos regarding the implementation of two of the President's executive orders that are designed to protect the homeland. These two memos provide explicit guidance to DHS staff on how to carry out two executive orders signed by the President on January 25th -- one dealing with interior enforcement and one dealing with border security. Perhaps most critically, the President is empowering DHS to carry out the immigration laws currently on the books.  Of course, DHS gave a full briefing on these memos this morning, but just to briefly summarize a few of the facts: The memo regarding the executive order ""Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States"" outlines several practices and policies in order to strengthen the efficient and faithful execution of this country's immigration laws. That includes hiring more ICE agents and officers, as well as additional mission support and legal staff necessary to support their activities. This memo also directs the establishment of the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office within ICE, fulfilling another major campaign promise of the President. This office will facilitate the engagement with victims and their families to ensure that their questions and concerns regarding immigration enforcement efforts are addressed.  The memo regarding the executive order ""Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements"" outlines the steps that DHS will take to secure the nation's southern border, prevent further illegal immigration, and to repatriate illegal immigrants swiftly, consistently, and humanely. This includes immediately identifying and allocating all sources of available funding for the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of a wall along our southern border and hiring of additional personnel, including 5,000 additional CBP border agents.  Again, I would refer you to DHS for further comment on these specific memos. There are factsheets and Q&As on the DHS website that address many of the intricacies in areas within each of these executive orders that you might have questions on. Also, this weekend, the President had calls with the President of Panama and the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago. Readouts of those calls have both been provided. The President's team this weekend also had a very productive meeting on the President's plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, and ensure that it is replaced with a system that works for all Americans. Back to the President's schedule today, in honor of Black History Month, the President started his day by visiting the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The museum opened last September and has quickly become one of Washington's most-visited attractions. The President was joined by a group of individuals that included his daughter, Ivanka; Dr. Ben Carson and his wife; Senator Tim Scott; Alveda King, the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; museum director Lonnie Bunch; Dr. David Skorton, who is the Secretary of the Smithsonian, as well as others. The President commented several times during his tour about how impressed he was with the museum. Some of the exhibits that he was particularly drawn to included the section on Harriet Tubman, which featured a shawl that was given to her by Queen Victoria in the late 1800s; the section of the museum that featured the courageous contribution of African Americans that have made to the United States military. And the President was particularly pleased by the Muhammad Ali exhibit with the quote, ""I shook up the world"" prominently displayed. The President also enjoyed viewing for the first time with Dr. and Mrs. Carson the exhibit dedicated to his extraordinary life. Similarly, Alveda King, who had never viewed the museum's exhibit on her uncle, the President was honored that he was able to share this experience with the two of them specifically. The President further expressed his appreciation for the tour, and said he looks forward to returning again. His desire is to honor the immense contributions of courageous African American leaders throughout our history by building a more unified country, dedicated to liberty and justice. This afternoon, the President will have a routine, classified National Security Council briefing in the Situation Room, in addition to his Presidential Daily Briefing, which he received earlier this morning.  Then, this evening the President will have dinner with Vice President Pence. I'm sure that they will discuss the Vice President's recent trip to Europe. The Vice President was an incredible representative for our nation and the President during his time, where he reiterated our support for our European allies in unified pursuit of the noble ideals of freedom, democracy, and justice, and the rule of law and discussing how to do more to encourage all NATO allies to meet their financial obligations and commitments.  During his speech before the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, the Vice President conveyed the administration's unwavering commitment to Europe's peace and prosperity, especially remembering the tens of thousands of Americans who gave their lives to defend those ideals during both World War I and II. These shared sacrifices are the backbone of our alliance and our mission of security through strength. During his time in Munich, the Vice President also met with nine world leaders. The Vice President and these leaders discussed the issues most pressing to them, including the escalating violence in eastern Ukraine and the role of NATO in the fight against ISIS. The Vice President also met in Brussels with President of Tusk -- Vice President Tusk of the Council of the European Union and NATO Secretary -- the NATO Secretary General.  As a candidate for office, President Trump actually called attention repeatedly to the fact that for too long, many of our NATO allies have not been sharing the financial burden. The President looks forward to working closely with NATO to advance our shared objectives. A strong NATO means a safer world. And the United States looks forward to working with our partners in NATO to achieve just that. Looking ahead to the President's upcoming schedule -- tomorrow, he will meet with Secretary of State Tillerson, fresh off his trip to Germany for the G20 Foreign Ministers Summit. They'll discuss the President's foreign policy agenda and the Secretary's upcoming trip to Mexico. Thursday morning, he'll have a listening session regarding job creation in the manufacturing sector with CEOs and business leaders from different industries. On Friday, he'll deliver remarks to the Conservative Political Action Conference. And we are just one week out today from the President's Joint Address to Congress.  The President will continue to work closely with his team to craft a speech that lays out his ambitious policy agenda that will benefit all Americans. Plans are currently in the works for pre- and post-address activities for the President and his staff. And we'll have more updates as the week goes on. Before I take your questions, I want to address the recent threats and acts of vandalism on Jewish community centers throughout the country. The President said this morning -- I just want to reiterate -- ""The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community centers are horrible and painful, and a very sad reminder of the work that we must do"" -- excuse me -- ""the work that must be done to root our hate and prejudice and evil."" With that, I'll take some of your questions. Jim Stinson.  Q: Sean, thank you. I was curious if the President regrets or wants to clarify his characterization -- by the way, I have two questions -- of the media as an ""enemy of the American people."" MR. SPICER: I think the President has been very clear that certain outlets have gone out of their way to not represent his record accurately, and it is a concern to him. And I think some reporters -- he has deep respect for the First Amendment, for the role of the press -- I've addressed this multiple times in the past. He has a healthy respect for the press. But I think that it's a two-way street, as I've also said before, and I think that the President understands that certain outlets have gone out of their way to not be completely accurate and fair in their coverage of what's going on. Q: Speaking of the media, I've noticed two times in the last week that you've been directly contradicted by two members of the media, one of them Bill Maher of HBO, who said that in front of guests at Mar-a-Lago, the President was briefed on the classified North Korean situation. MR. SPICER: Say that again, I'm sorry. Q: The President and the Prime Minister of Japan were briefed in front of guests -- MR. SPICER: No, I didn't say that. Q: No, no, no, this is what was being said on HBO, that the President and the Prime Minister were briefed on classified information in front of guests at Mar-a-Lago. I just want to clarify, did that happen? Did they -- MR. SPICER: No. No. I think I walked through this timeline before, Jim. And it's amazing -- a photo gets put out, the President has got a piece of paper, and the immediate conclusion is he's got to be talking about classified information. The President was briefed on the situation in North Korea prior to the dinner, in a SCIF, that's at Mar-a-Lago. He went and had dinner. He discussed the logistics of the press conference, which I've talked to you all before -- there was a question as to where to hold the press conference. They had a discussion about the logistics of it. And subsequent to that dinner, he was briefed again in a SCIF with updates on the situation in North Korea. That's it, plain and simple.  But to your first question, I think that it's amazing that the immediate jump of conclusion to several outlets was, well, there's a piece of paper, it must be classified. I don't -- it's amazing to see that and to see people jump to that conclusion that he's surrounded by his staff and members of the Japanese delegation, the conclusion is they must be doing something nefarious or wrong. In fact, he followed every procedure that's laid out. And I think in some cases, it's disheartening to realize that those are the kind of immediate conclusions that somebody jumps to. So when you talk about coverage, we have a free press. We have the right for people to say and do what they believe. But at some point, it is incumbent upon people to try to get it right. And in that case, it wasn't even attempted. It was a jump to conclusion by many to say that there must be something else going on when, in fact, we were able to provide a very, very clear tick-tock as to what had happened in that. Jessica. Q: Sean, a question about the resignation of 10 people on the Asian American Council. That happened last week. And in the letter, they said in part, ""We can no longer serve a President whose policies aim to create outcomes that are diametrically opposite to our principles, goals and charge."" First of all, what's the White House's reaction? And do you plan to appoint your own members to this council? MR. SPICER: Those members of that council were political appointees of the Obama administration. Their terms were set to expire this year. So it's not surprising in the sense that they were appointees of Barack Obama. They were going to have their terms expire. Q: But in terms of -- But again, but -- I get it, but most political appointees from other agencies or whatever would automatically resign because of the term of these individuals, they would carry through until later in the year. But I don't think it's surprising that people who were appointed by Barack Obama to fulfill his agenda suddenly understand that there is a new administration in town and didn't want to stay on board. But we will make sure that we appoint people to this task force. It's important. It's something that's provided guidance to multiple presidents in the past, and we will continue to do that. Shannon. Q: On the statement today about the anti-Semitic acts, what specifically is the President going to do to address that issue? And, along those lines, there were reports earlier on that he was considering changing the mandate of this countering violent extremism program to focus just on Islamic extremist groups. Is he still considering that, or would he also leave the scope of the program to also consider -- MR. SPICER: Are you talking about the travel executive order? Q: No, no, no, this is the countering violent extremism program that -- MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there. There's nothing to announce on that front. And secondly, to the first part of your question, I think the President is going to do what he's talked about since election night. It's through deed and action, talk about how we can unify this country and speak out against hate, anti-Semitism, racism. And he's going to continue to do that. And I think that he will show you over the course of months and years, through what he does in terms of his policies and his speech, that he is going to be a President that brings people together, that unites them, and that speaks very, very forcefully against those who are seeking to do hate or to tear people down because of their religion or their gender or the color of their skin. I mean, those are all things that I think the President was clear on. John. Q: Two questions unrelated, if I could. The next big piece in the immigration profile here at the White House is going to be the new executive order. Is the President confident that this one will pass legal muster? And if he is, what gives him that confidence? MR. SPICER: Well, I think -- first, I want to be clear that we feel confident that we're still going to prevail on the case -- the merits of the case. I think that as was seen in the case of Massachusetts, once it is fully adjudicated, we will prevail because the authority is granted to the President to do what he has to, to protect the country. So I feel very, very confident about where we're going to go. The second track that he's made very clear as well is that until that occurs, we're going to have a dual-track system. And then we're going to make sure that we implement a second executive order that is tailored to achieve the same goals but in accordance with what the court said. So we've been working very closely with the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice and the team here at the White House to make sure that the next step achieves the President's goal of protecting the country and does so in a way that recognizes the concerns that the court had until we prevail at a later time. So it's a dual-track thing. Q: Will this administration send American terror suspects picked up overseas to Guantanamo Bay for interrogation or prosecution? MR. SPICER: I am not going to discuss that right now. As the President has said very clearly before, we don't telegraph what we're going to do. I think he has made very clear, though, that he believes that Guantanamo Bay does serve a very, very healthy purpose in our national security in making sure that we don't bring terrorists to our seas. But I'm not going to get into what we may or may not do in the future. Q: Including American citizens? MR. SPICER: Again, I'm just not going to -- Q: Sean, I want to give you a chance to respond to something because I think the President's remarks and your clarification about where he stands on anti-Semitism is clear. But after that statement was made by the President, The Anne Frank Center released a pretty strongly worded one, saying that these remarks, while well-received, are a Band-Aid on the cancer within the Trump administration, saying that there is, whether blessed or otherwise, a sense of xenophobia within this administration. What do you think about that? MR. SPICER: Look, the President has made clear since the day he was elected and, frankly, going back through the campaign, that he is someone who seeks to unite this country. He has brought a diverse group of folks into his administration, both in terms of actual positions and people that he has sought the advice of. And I think he has been very forceful with his denunciation of people who seek to attack people because of their hate -- excuse me, because of their religion, because of their gender, because of the color of their skin. And it is something that he is going to continue to fight and make very, very clear that he has no place in this administration.  But I think that it's ironic that no matter how many times he talks about this, that it's never good enough. Today I think was an unbelievably forceful comment by the President as far as his denunciation of the actions that are currently targeted towards Jewish community centers, but I think that he's been very clear previous to this that he wants to be someone that brings this country together and not divide people, especially in those areas. So I saw that statement. I wish that they had praised the President for his leadership in this area. And I think that hopefully, as time continues to go by, they recognize his commitment to civil rights, to voting rights, to equality for all Americans. Q: Sean, on that, the southern part of --  MR. SPICER: We started early with the two questions. Q: Sorry. Sean, Southern Poverty -- I think you'll want to respond to this. MR. SPICER: Okay. Q: Southern Poverty Law Center said that the number of anti-Muslim groups in the U.S. has tripled between 2015 and 2016, during the time of the campaign. Is this message within the administration -- anti-Semitism is not allowed, xenophobia is not allowed -- anti-Muslim sentiment within the administration, has the President been forceful about that particular issue? MR. SPICER: I think that the President, in terms of his desire to combat radical Islamic terrorism, he understands that people who want to express a peaceful position have every right in our Constitution. But if you come here or want to express views that seek to do our country or our people harm, he is going to fight it aggressively, whether it's domestic acts that are going on here or attempts through people abroad to come into this country. So there's a big difference between preventing attacks and making sure that we keep this country safe so that there is no loss of life in allowing people to express themselves in accordance with our First Amendment. Those are two very, very different, different, different things.  Q: Sean, you talked about how the manufacturing -- I didn't know where you were going. MR. SPICER: I was (inaudible) in the back. (Laughter.)  Q: I saw the manufacturing CEOs are coming on Thursday, so let me ask you something that's important to them, which is the border adjustment tax. The President earlier this year called it ""too complicated."" Does he still feel that way? And whether he feels this is complicated or not, is there something within the administration one way or another about whether the President, the administration wants to see this in or out of the tax package? MR. SPICER: So there's several pieces to that that I'll try to unpack. That counts as, like, eight questions.  Q: Does he feel it's complicated, and what's your preference? MR. SPICER: So, first of all, on the meeting on Thursday, this is going to be a really historic opportunity for CEOs to come in and talk to members of the White House staff and others through various agencies about how we can create jobs, how regulations are stifling economic growth. And I think we'll have further details on that, but this is going to be a real interesting opportunity to really create a dialogue I think in a manner that hasn't been done before -- but I'm not going to get ahead of myself on this -- where we can really discuss some of the inhibitors to job creation, job retraining, what do we need for American workers to get them ahead of the curve. With respect to specific policy positions, I think the President has been very clear that in the next couple weeks we expect to have a tax plan that gets out there. That is being worked on continuously. And so I'm not going to get in front of that. While the CEOs are here, I'm sure beyond some of these things, that's an opportunity for them to express what some of those policies are that are both helping them create jobs and grow the economy, and also inhibiting them. So let's let that conversation play out.  Yes. Q: Okay, thank you, Sean. My name is Raquel (ph) from TV Global News (ph) Brazil. And I have a question. There are doubts in Brazil right now about what's going to happen to the relationship between the two countries with the new administration, especially related to immigration and also to trade deals. Does President Trump also plan to review policies -- bilateral policies with Brazil in trade deals? And also, my second question, how does the administration see the current turmoil -- economical and political turmoil in Brazil?  And one more question, if I might. (Laughter.) President Trump spoke with some foreign leaders from South America, like Argentina, Colombia and Peru, but not -- it was the Vice President that spoke with President Temer from Brazil. Why is that? MR. SPICER: Well, obviously, we cherish our relationship with Brazil. I think there's a timing factor here and I think we'll look forward to speaking with the President soon. So I wouldn't read too much into that right now. It's just a matter of getting things on the schedule. We're going to review all the trade deals that are out there. The President has made very clear some of them have occurred well into a decade, two decades ago. I think the idea is to make sure that we are looking at all of the trade deals we have throughout the globe to make sure that they continue to benefit America and American workers. And in many cases, we can update these deals.  So it's not any one particular country. I think that we're going to look throughout the whole host of trade agreements, and then other trade-related agreements that we have with countries to make sure that they are the most up-to-date and they address the technological advances that have occurred, and look at the various services -- whether it's financial services or manufacturing -- and that they reflect the current state of play. So this isn't any one country. I think the President made clear throughout the campaign and subsequent that he wants to review every trade deal to make sure that America and American workers are maintaining the best deal possible. Corbett (ph). Oh, I'm sorry. Q: And on the turmoil, how does the administration see the turmoil in Brazil now? MR. SPICER: I'm going to -- I think that's a question for the Department of State right now.  Corbett, yeah. Q: Thanks, Sean. Two questions for you. One on the NSC meeting later this afternoon. Is that the first meeting of the National Security Council of the President with all the principals there? MR. SPICER: No, that is just a routine briefing. But because of the nature of it, it's happening in the Situation Room. Q: But is that with staff, or is that with -- MR. SPICER: Staff. Q: Okay, so it's not with, like, the principals committee.  MR. SPICER: No. Q: When do you anticipate the first formal meeting of the National Security Council? MR. SPICER: Well, I think General McMaster got here at noon today, so -- (laughter) -- we move fast, but I think that we need to give him a few days probably to get his team together. So the President was obviously very pleased with the selection. I think when you saw the bipartisan support that General McMaster received from the variety of the political spectrum -- people who have served Republicans and Democrats, academics, pundits, columnists -- you know that he made an outstanding choice. We want to get him in, show him around the office a little bit, and then get him going. But when we have a date to announce the next meeting, we'll let you know. Q: The joint address for next week, what's the President's goal for that address? MR. SPICER: I think that -- I'll have a further update as the week goes on, and we'll have briefings. The President is going to lay out I think two main things -- where we've come and where we're going. I think that he is very pleased with the progress that he has made so far in the first month in office, and I think it's an opportunity to remind members of Congress and the American people what he promised them on the campaign trail, what he's done already in a very significant way to achieve and fulfill those promises that he made, but also talk about the challenges that we have as a nation and where we're going. And that's everything from our relationship with other countries in this world to some of the various domestic problems that we face, the challenges that we face in cities, health care, education. But the President wants to make sure that the American people have a very clear indication as to where he's taking this country and why he's going to enact the policies he's going to enact. John. George, I'm sorry. Q: Thanks a lot, Sean. Let me ask you a question about the Vice President's European trip. I'm curious whether he received any commitments from our European allies to commit more in terms of their financial contribution to NATO. MR. SPICER: I think several of them -- I saw Chancellor Merkel's comments previous to that, noting that they understand that the U.S. is asking for that commitment. Look, we're one of the only countries -- there's a handful -- that are doing what NATO requires, which is 2 percent of GDP. Some of them are at 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, and some of them are below that. But we've got to ask them to do what they agreed to do. And I think we've had a very positive reaction from most of these NATO countries that understand that the financial agreement that they agreed to is something that they need to live up to.  And I think the Vice President continued to receive assurances, much like the President has through his foreign leader calls, where people not only understand it but are willing to follow through on it. Q: So it's an ongoing process, or -- MR. SPICER: Of course it's an ongoing -- I mean, I think we need to follow up to make sure that the commitments that they're making on the phone or in person, in the case of the Vice President, are followed up. Dave. Q: Sean, thanks. The DHS memos today -- obviously these immigration enforcement efforts cost money, hiring more agents. MR. SPICER: Right. Q: Do you envision that the current budget is sufficient, or are you going to need to go to Congress for more money? MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think right now ICE and DHS in particular, as well as CBP, are looking at what this is going to cost and how much and putting a request together, and then figuring out how much can be handled through reallocation of resources and how much we can save maybe in another area, but then also work with Congress. Q: One other subject, different matter. There was an election report out today that the President raised more small campaign donations in 2016 than either Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders combined. Did he have a reaction to that? Has he seen that? MR. SPICER: I don't know, and I would ask you to probably go through the RNC for that. That's a political matter that we generally don't discuss. Yeah. Q: Sean, the National Center for Transgender Equality, citing reliable sources, says the Trump administration today will rescind Obama-era guidance requiring schools to allow transgender kids to use the restroom consistent with their gender identity. Will the Trump administration rescind that guidance? MR. SPICER: Right now that's an issue that the Department of Justice and the Department of Education are addressing. I would tell you that -- and I think that there will be further guidance coming from DOJ in particular with respect to not just the executive order, but also the case that's in front of the Supreme Court.  The President has maintained for a long time that this is a states' rights issue and not one for the federal government. So while there will be further guidance coming out on this, I think that all you have to do is look at what the President's view has been for a long time -- that this is not something that the federal government should be involved in; this is a states' rights issue.  Matt. Q: In the wake of the Vice President's trip to Europe, there's questions as to the administration's position on the future of the European Union with regard to a number of political movements across the continent advocating for the disbandment eventually of the European Union. I wanted to see if you could clarity the administration's position on the future of the European Union. MR. SPICER: I think the Vice President had great meetings with several European Union leaders and made it very clear to them that we'll continue to work with them, and reaffirmed our commitment to working with these nations. I mean, there's no update on that. Cecilia. Q: Thank you. On immigration, on the DHS memo, two parts, if I may. Is one of the goals here mass deportation? MR. SPICER: No, not at all. This isn't -- look, I think what we have to get back to is understanding a couple things. There's a law in place that says if you're in this country illegally, that we have an obligation to make sure that the people who are in our country are here legally. What the order sets out today is ensures that the million-or-so people that have been adjudicated already, that ICE prioritizes, creates a system of prioritization, and makes sure that we walk through that system in a way that protects this country. This is consistent with everything the President has talked about, which is prioritizing the people who are here who represent a threat to public safety or have a criminal record. And all this does is lay out the exact procedures to make sure that that subgroup of people who pose a threat to our nation because of a conviction or a violation of public safety or have a criminal record are adjudicated first and foremost. That's it, plain and simple. Q: So is then -- a follow-up to that. Is the White House's message to date to undocumented people in this country whose only crime is being in this country illegally, ""Don't worry, or you're on notice""? MR. SPICER: No, the message from this White House and from the DHS is that those people who are in this country and pose a threat to our public safety or have committed a crime will be the first to go and we will be aggressively making sure that that occurs. That is what the priority is. Q: What about the others who aren't? They're watching this fearful right now. MR. SPICER: Cecilia, the President has said multiple times that we've got to look at this issue on a very, very holistic way. And the number-one priority when you look at the scope of how many people are in the country illegally, the number-one priority is making sure that people who pose a threat to this country are immediately dealt with. And this is not a small group of people; we're talking close to a million people who have already been adjudicated and had their status processed through a formal due process system. And so what we need to do now is to make sure that we focus the resources and the efforts on those people going first and foremost. And the factsheet and the information that we put out lays that out very, very clearly what is being done. But for so long, the people at ICE and CBP had their hands cuffed behind them. And when they were going to deal with the mission of their job, the last administration had so many carve-outs for who could be and who couldn't be adjudicated that it made it very difficult for the customs and enforcement people to do their job and enforce the laws of this country. But right now, what we've done is to make sure that they have the ability and the guidance and the resources to do what their mission is. And that's it, plain and simple. And the President is consistent with his priority of making sure that those people who pose a threat to this country are the first ones to go.  Alexis. Q: Sean, on immigration, just to follow up, the President has a carve-out himself for DACA. MR. SPICER: Yeah. Q: Can you explain the process -- expand on what you were saying on Thursday about the process that the administration is taking to decide -- MR. SPICER: And this is what I was basically talking to Cecilia about, which is the President has made clear when you have 12, 14, 15 million people in the country illegally, that there has to be a system of priority. And right now, ICE's priority is going to make sure that we focus first and foremost on that. Specifically, in the guidance, it talks about the DACA and DAPA, unless someone who fits under that program fits into the sub-category is not subject to what is being dealt with now. Remember, everybody who is here illegally is subject to removal at any time. That is consistent with every country, not just ours. If you're in this country in an illegal manner, that obviously there's a provision that could ensure that you be removed. But the priority that the President has laid forward and the priority that ICE is putting forward through DHS's guidance is to make sure that the people who have committed a crime or pose a threat to our public safety are the priority of their efforts, first and foremost. Katelyn. Q: John Kasich -- Q: Let me follow. The President has also, and his team has also had reservations about undocumented people in the United States who are beneficiaries of public assistance or access to benefits, either at the state or the federal level. What is the President going to be doing to either issue guidance or executive action of some sort to indicate that he would like to preclude that from continuing? MR. SPICER: I think we have talked in the past about the respect that the President has for taxpayer money with respect to sanctuary cities and the enforcement measures that he's putting forward on immigration. Right now, obviously, the actions today are focused on people who are in this country and what we need to do on our southern border to facilitate the building of the wall that he's talked about.  So we're doing this one step at a time in a very methodical way, and right now the focus is to make sure that ICE and CBP and DHS have the authority and the resources to carry out that first mission. We will have more -- and then continues to see that immigration is one of those issues that he was very, very clear and consistent on in the campaign, and we're going to continue to implement the policies that he talked about to keep the country safe. Katelyn. Q: Thank you. John Kasich has been a very vocal critic of President Trump, even in the campaign, saying his immigration plan was crazy, his statement that the elections were rigged was silly, and he did not endorse him and did not vote for him. What is the President hoping to accomplish with their meeting at the White House on Friday? MR. SPICER: So, Governor Kasich has reached out on multiple occasions to meet with the President to follow on, and the President has shown through the transition and since his time in office that he wants to meet with anybody that can help move this country forward and share in his vision. I think that includes people who are with him, who are not with him, who are on the other side of the aisle, who are independents, union workers, business leaders.  Now that he is President -- and, frankly, I would again date it back to the transition -- he understands that he's the President for every American. And he's talked consistently about having a united country. And you do that by bringing people together, whether or not they agree with you on every issue, or one or two issues. But if there's common ground that can be found to move the country forward, then great. And I think so many of the President's priority issues are issues that Ohio is dealing with and that he wants to make sure that he can continue to work with Governor Kasich so that every American benefits. April. Q: Did Kasich ask for the meeting? MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: Okay, what did the President gain from his tour today? You talked about where he visited, the exhibits that he visited. Did he also visit slavery? And the reason why I'm asking is, is because when he was candidate Trump, he said things like ""we made this country,"" meaning white America, and not necessarily black. Did he gain -- MR. SPICER: I don't know why you would say that. What do you mean? Q: No, no, no, he said that. I heard him say that. MR. SPICER: No, no, but look -- the answer to your question is -- one of the first exhibits that he visited was one of the slavery exhibits. And the director walked him through some very amazing stories and statistics about where slavery was prevailing, not just in traditional Southern colonies but throughout the country. So they did have a very robust discussion about slavery early on in the tour.  And I think that it was a very eye-opening and powerful tour for him, and, frankly, for every American. And I would encourage any American that can find the time and get in, because it's so popular. But it really is enlightening as far as parts of our history that people may not fully appreciate or know, and the contributions and the sacrifices that so many Americans have made that are a critical piece to our history that sometimes don't get the attention they deserve.  So I think the President walked away from there -- and I mentioned in the remarks that he mentioned to Lonnie that he wanted to come back, because you can't do it justice. And it's much like the Holocaust Museum where you go through it once and then you sit there and start thinking of all the things that you saw, and think, you know, I'd like to go back and more fully explore what I saw because it piqued some degree of interest or intellectual curiosity.  But he was very taken aback. It's a very, very powerful institution and tour, and it covers a lot of ground. I think he was really proud to share it with Dr. Carson. I mean, when you walk through that museum and you see all of the elements of our history, when you walk up to this one glass exhibit that is Dr. Carson's scrubs and pictures of him, and to experience that with him and his wife for the first time, and you realize how amazing that is for any American to be part of a Smithsonian, and you're standing with Dr. Carson and his wife where he is experiencing it with you for the first time and how powerful that must have been was, I think, a real interesting opportunity for him to sit there, hand to hand, with another American and watch them be part of American history. And you also appreciate some of the real contributions that Dr. Carson has made to medicine and the depth and breadth of his accomplishments. Q: And lastly, kind of putting this with the next question, is there any advancement on the CBC meeting with the President? And also, the head of the CBC said he was wondering if the President saw anything from current and past members of the CBC while he was in the museum, to get a little bit of information on them before this meeting happens. MR. SPICER: I'll have further updates on that. I know the President looks forward to that meeting, and I think that we're in the process of trying to begin setting that up. And so I'll have further updates on that once we get closer. I know that we've got some additional work before the month concludes on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and some meetings that we're working on with them. But I want to get them locked in before I go further. Q: What did he think about the members that he saw in the museum? MR. SPICER: Well, when you walk through one of them, there's a big jumbotron, and we paused for a while, and John Lewis was there giving a very powerful speech. And we just paused and watched that for a little while. So, again, I think that, respectfully, when you walk through a museum like this there's a lot of moments where you're just stopping and taking it in, and there's -- if you haven't been there, you walk up this one ramp and they stop and there's two big screens, and one of them is a video screen, and it's a massive jumbotron -- Q: The civil rights -- MR. SPICER: Right. And we watched the video of John Lewis talking there and describing his efforts in championing voting and civil rights. So I know the President paused and watched it and listened to it. And again, I would just go back to how he described his overall -- we didn't dissect the different things, but I watched him and it was a very powerful experience for him, and I know he looks forward to going back.  Hallie. Q: Sean, two questions for you. First one on undocumented immigrants. You just made very clear that the President's priority is to deport those who pose a threat to public safety.  MR. SPICER: Correct. Q: I know you're familiar with the case in Arizona of the mother, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos. Is she a threat to this country? MR. SPICER: I'm going to leave that up to ICE. We don't get involved from the White House to particular cases. That's not -- Q: But she's a symbol --  MR. SPICER: You're right, and I understand. Q: But is she a threat to public safety, though? MR. SPICER: But, Hallie, I think the answer is, is that ICE determined that she had violated the law in a way that was in accordance with this. Again, we've got to go back to this idea that our job, especially here at the White House, isn't to call balls and strikes and say, well, this person only violated part of the law, or let them go on this.  If this was any other subject, if this was tax evasion and we said, well, they only really violated a little bit of -- they only cheated on their taxes a little, you wouldn't be saying hey, should they really be going to be prison or should they be getting a fine? At some point, laws are laws. And if people have a problem with the law, whether it's at the local, state or federal issue, then we should petition our lawmakers and the executive at that particular branch of government and change it. But our job shouldn't be to figure out should this individual not have to abide by the law, should this individual get a pass. If we want to change the law, we've got a very amazing process here in this country to both create and change laws. And so I don't want to comment on the specifics of any one case because I think that then puts the White House in a position of deciding who is following the law and who isn't, and who should get a pass. The bottom -- Q: But isn't it different from you just said of prioritization of cases? There's a difference --  MR. SPICER: No, no, there's a difference. When you have 13 or 14 million people, they're in the country -- you know, I think it's one thing to say prioritize people who pose a threat to public safety and go after this individual or that individual, or whatever. There's no question, you have to have priorities in anything -- what do you do first, what do you do second, what do you do third. And when you're talking about, 13, 14, 15, potentially more, millions of people in this country, the President needed to give guidance, especially after what they went through in the last administration where there were so many carve-outs that ICE agents and CBP members had to figure out each individual whether or not they fit in a particular category and they could adjudicate that case. The President wanted to take the shackles off individuals in these agencies and say: You have a mission, there are laws that need to be followed; you should do your mission and follow the law. And for specific cases, I would refer you to ICE in particular and do that. Q: Sean, where did you get the 13 and 14 million number? MR. SPICER: Hold on, Hallie is on number two. Q: Thank you. Q: The 13, 14 million number -- where did you get that number? MR. SPICER: Glenn, will you please not interrupt her? Q: Do you want to take that now? MR. SPICER: No, no, I think -- I'm not going to allow you to be interrupted.  Q: So the second question is on the anti-Semitism comments that you referenced from the podium, the President made very clear. You said, though, that he has taken opportunities in the past. Just last week, though, he had the opportunities to deliver a message to the American people about anti-Semitism. He made very clear he was not anti-Semitic and he was, in fact, insulted by that. But as far as a broader message to the American people, he declined to offer one. Is the President comfortable with his obligation as the leader of this country to deliver that kind of broad and forceful message to Americans? And if so, why didn't he do it sooner in the case of these attacks? MR. SPICER: Well, I think the idea, Hallie, that -- he has. And I think there's a point at which he talked literally on election night about uniting this country and making sure that all Americans, et cetera. And every time there's an instance, it's interesting -- I mean, I get a question, ""Is he going to denounce this one, is he going to denounce this one?"" At some point, the question is asked and answered. He has stood very forcefully against -- Q: That's not what I'm asking. I'm not asking -- MR. SPICER: What are you -- Q: I'm asking, is he comfortable with his role as the person who needs to be delivering a broader message to America, not denouncing it, which he did clearly today. MR. SPICER: Right. And I think that he is very comfortable and understands that as the leader of the free world, the President of this country, the Commander-in-Chief, that he has an awesome responsibility to make it very clear where we're going as a country and what our values are, and that he has spoken very forcefully that we don't stand for this kind of behaviors, and words, and intolerance, that we are a country that should bring people together and that we shouldn't tolerate people who are hating on individuals because of their gender or because of their religion or the color of their skin, or a variety of other things, but that there's a point at which it's asked and answered.  And I think the President has been very clear over and over again, going back through the campaign, the transition and now, that that's the kind of President that he wants to be, that's the kind of country that he wants to lead. Trey. Q: Thanks, Sean. Following the DHS memos this morning, the ACLU said the courts won't allow these orders to become a reality. How is the administration preparing for another potential legal battle? And do you have any response to the ACLU? MR. SPICER: Well, I think we have done a phenomenal job of working with the various departments, particularly DHS and DOJ, State, and through the White House staff, to make sure that we are well within any concerns that the court might have.  And as I mentioned, I think it's important to continue to emphasize we feel as though the first one did that as well, and we were vindicated several times in the court. We have an issue with the 9th Circuit and I think we will overcome that, ultimately, on the merits. But in the meantime, a dual-track is something that we wanted to pursue to make sure that we do everything we can, as I mentioned before, to keep the country safe. Q: Sean, thank you. The Australian foreign minister is here today, meeting the Vice President. MR. SPICER: I'm sorry, say that again. Q: The Australian foreign minister is meeting the Vice President today and also the Secretary of State tomorrow. I guess we can assume that the U.S.-Australia refugee deal will come up. Now, last time we spoke, the President was still considering and reviewing a deal. Can you just update us on what the current position is? MR. SPICER: We'll have a readout of that. Q: And just --  MR. SPICER: Okay, of course everyone gets two. (Laughter.) Q: If you could just update us on the current position on the deal. And also, given that recent exposure on the President's distaste for it, will Australia be expected to return the favor? MR. SPICER: Look, again, I would wait. We'll have a readout after that call as far as what they discussed. But I've got nothing -- I don't want to get ahead of the Vice President's meeting with either the Secretary of State or the Vice President. Kristen. Q: Thank you. I have two questions. One, on the immigration refugee executive order that we're expecting in the coming days, so that it withstands legal challenges, can you tell us what the language might look like as it relates to Syrian refugees? MR. SPICER: I appreciate the effort, but when we have it ready we'll get it out. And I think part of this is --  Q: (Inaudible) ban on Syrian refugees? MR. SPICER: Excuse me? Again, I appreciate the second try, but we're not ready to announce it. And part of it is, is that we're making sure that it is completely ready to go. And so when we have that, we will get it out to you. And I would just -- the reason that we haven't announced it is it's not ready to be announced. Q: I want to try one more on -- MR. SPICER: Of course.  Q: -- the comments that the President made today about anti-Semitism. In terms of the timing, obviously he was asked about it, but they also came after his daughter, Ivanka, sent out that tweet. Has she counseled him? Was she one of the people saying it's important for you to forcefully denounce this? Why today? MR. SPICER: Because the President was visiting the African American Museum, he wanted to make it very clear. I think it was very powerful that, while there, and while understanding the struggles of so many -- and we talk about how one of the beauties of history is that we don't repeat itself. And I think that when you're at a museum like that and seeing the struggles that so many Americans faced and overcame, that you want to remind people that there is still issues that our country is grappling with and that there is no place for that hate and for that language. And I think -- as I mentioned, it was a very powerful opportunity for him to say that and to make clear, again, what his opinions were. Q: Does he regret not doing it last week, Sean? MR. SPICER: I'm sorry? Q: Does he regret not stating this comment last week? MR. SPICER: The President was very clear. That was a very -- I think, as I mentioned to Hallie, he has discussed this over and over again. I think there's a point to which his position is abundantly clear. His attempts and his desire and his rhetoric to unite the country has been expressed over and over again. Sarah. Q: Thanks, Sean. The New York Times is reporting that Trump's budget director is preparing a budget that eliminates the Export-Import Bank. But several lawmakers, including Senator Heitkamp, have come out of private meetings with President Trump and said that in those private meetings he expressed support for the export bank. So which is it? Does he support Ex-Im or does he support eliminating it? MR. SPICER: I can confirm that the OMB director -- the budget director is working on a budget. (Laughter.) Beyond that, I'm not going to get ahead of the OMB director right now. They are drafting a budget, they are talking to members of Congress and other interested parties about funding levels and such, but we're not at a position to go yet. Yes. Q: Sean, just wanted to circle on Alexis's question. Since the DHS guidance did not eliminate DACA, does that mean that the program is remaining in place, that it's a settled matter and it's not going away? MR. SPICER: No, Jordan. What it means is that this particular enforcement is tailored to what I have been referencing over and over again -- that what we're talking about today is the implementation of those two executive orders, one specifically that's tasking the agencies under DHS to address a very specific problem of the million or so, plus or minus, people that they have identified, that they have then adjudicated with already going through the process to be adjudicated and taken out of the country. Q: That means a decision on DACA could come any day.  MR. SPICER: That's right, exactly. It just means that this -- what it means, more than anything, is that this order does not address that and it's very clear in the Q&A -- and, again, I would refer you back to DHS's website that has all of that. Goyal. Q: Thank you very much. Two questions please. One, it's been one month on the job for you and for the President, and you are already talk of the town around the globe. (Laughter.) My two questions are, one --  MR. SPICER: My wife would disagree with you. (Laughter.) It's not always positive, too. Q: It looks like, Sean, that the President's order is working at least around the globe because more than 60,000 Pakistanis have been deported by Saudi Arabia. But they're saying that they were illegals and also they're a threat to the country. And also, at the same time, Pakistani government is arresting hundreds of terrorists inside the country. Any presidential message? MR. SPICER: Look, I'm not going to -- there's nothing that I have in terms of an update of what's going on in Pakistan. I would refer you to the Department of State with respect to specific policies. But the broader point that you're making is I think each country needs to look at what they need to do to control the people that are entering their country and keep their people safe. When you look at our laws in particular, and compare them to so many other countries around the globe, we actually tend to probably fall in the lower end of how tough our immigration policies are vis-–∞-vis someone else. Q: Sean, my second question. MR. SPICER: I'm sorry. Q: As far as illegal immigrants are concerned in the U.S., millions of illegal immigrants that were waiting for the last eight or ten years that they might see a light in the dark tunnel, and now they're hoping that President Trump will have a light for them. So what is the President's message for them who are in this country for five, 10, 15 or 20 years but they're not -- they don't have any criminal records? MR. SPICER: Well, look, the President has said before he's got a big heart. And I think that as we continue to develop policy on immigration, it's going to be, as we've talked about in the past, prioritized -- what we go after first, second third. The President has made very clear he understands the plight of some of those individuals. He's got a big heart. He understands the impact it has on many families, many communities. But we will continue to develop policies that will address that. And again, today's focus is specifically on those two executive orders, and I'm going to limit it to that. Q: Sean, at the beginning of the month, Senator John McCain sent a letter to the President requesting that the administration provide arms to Ukrainians fighting Russian separatists within their country. When will the President respond to Senator McCain's letter? And what is the administration's position on lethal aid to Ukrainians fighting Russian separatists? MR. SPICER: I don't have anything for you on that. I'll try to get back to you on that. I know that we're very pleased to watch Senator McCain praise the pick of General McMaster. That's obviously someone that we will consult with. But we were pleased to see so much support for him. Scott Newman (ph). Q: On Russia -- critics of the President have said that at time he doesn't talk tough enough on the subject. General McMaster, though, has been labeled by a lot of people as being pretty hawkish. I'm curious what, if any, difference in tone or tenor or strategy we should expect now that they're working together. Q: Well, I think, as I mentioned a couple times, I think there is widespread praise for General McMaster and his understanding and command of national security matters, foreign policy matters. He's going to be a great asset to the President's national security team. But ultimately, the President has always been the decider, whether it's Russia or any other issue. And I think you're right, he has made it very clear that if he can get a deal with Russia, something that the last several administrations have tried to do, that he's going to do it. And if he can't, he won't. But he is going to try. And I think his success as a businessman and negotiator should be seen as a positive sign for him to be able to do that. But he understands that if he can find common ground on defeating ISIS and combatting terrorism, growing the economy where we can find areas of economic interest, then we're going to do it. But that's where we're going to continue to work with Russia if we can. He'll get a deal. If he can't, he won't. But he's going to try. And I think where others have failed, he's going to make sure that he does everything possible to make sure that if it's in the interest of the United States he will get a deal. Q: I have another question on General McMaster. So how much leeway is he going to get to restructure, to bring on his own people? There were some reports that Admiral Harward was not allowed to, or others as well. So can you address that? MR. SPICER: Thank you. I can. He will have 100 percent. The President has been very, very clear with that. He is the National Security Advisor, and he will have whatever he needs to implement a successful team.  But with respect to Admiral Harward that you brought up, Admiral Harward made it very, very clear that he wanted this job, he would love to take it. He was impressed with the team. But during the course of discussions, it came up -- he said: Before I continue with this discussion, I need to address some financial and family concerns. He went back, he came back to us and said, I am unable to continue the discussions because of there's some financial concerns and some family issues that we have. I spent 40 years serving this country in the United States Navy. I talked to him again Saturday night, and he said: If there's another opening in a year or two, I would be honored, I am so impressed with the team that's there.  And I would urge people to actually talk to him. He was so excited about being part of the team. He was available to as many reporters as he could take. We gave out his information -- his contact information. And he's been very clear. He wrote a letter to the President prior to -- first thing Tuesday morning. He was in the UAE, he sent the letter over and we had it first thing in the morning, where he said, because of family concerns, because of some financial constraints, having served this nation for 40 years, I can't take this job, but I'm unbelievably impressed.  All of the rumors about the discretion that he would have over staff or any other thing were 100 percent false. He's made it clear that he would love to serve in the future, that he was impressed with the team, that he wanted to do this. There were just some constraints financially and family-wise that come with -- or after having served 40 years in the military, sacrifices both financially and family-wise that he had had to make.  But I talked to him several times, and the team has talked to him. But ultimately, the President was very, very impressed with General McMaster. He had always been one of the individuals that he thought stood above so many other folks. He was impressed with the entire list, John Bolton and others. But so many people had spoken to him. General Mattis, Tom Cotton, other senators really praised General McMaster's command of the issues, his management, his style, his understanding of the geopolitical landscape. And I think that's why you saw such amazing widespread bipartisan praise for him, and why he will be such an asset to the national security team. So, ultimately, we ended up with the best choice. And I think that's going to benefit not just this administration but our entire nation. Q: Sean, can we expect him to get anyone else from the top of -- any senior people at the NSC? MR. SPICER: I'm sorry? Q: Can we expect that he may replace any others in the NSC? MR. SPICER: Again, I just can't be any clearer. I think that we've got an amazing team. He's been impressed with them. But the President has, as he did with other candidates, told them that they would lead the team and that he would have the discretion of it. Jeff. Q: I just wanted to follow on that. You said that he has the full authority to structure his office as he sees fit. Does that extend to the principals committee, as well? After he comes in and takes a look at the whole apparatus, if he advises the President and he would prefer not to have the chief strategist as a member of the principals committee, would the President -- MR. SPICER: I think the President has made clear to him he's got full authority to structure the national security team the way he wants. Obviously, with something like that, he would come to the President and make that recommendation. But the President would take that under serious consideration. I don't want to go ahead with this person or that person or structure, but the President made it very clear with him and the other candidates that they had 100 percent control and authority over the national security committee. Thank you, guys. I'll see you tomorrow. Q: Will McMaster have to retire? Can you clarify that? MR. SPICER: No, he will stay on active duty.  Q: Does that require Senate confirmation then? MR. SPICER: No. He will stay on active duty. That was the case with Powell and I think some other folks. Q: One more clarification just before you go. So when the new EO comes out, you won't rescind the original one and you'll leave it in place? MR. SPICER: That's correct. Yes. Thank you, guys. END 2:41 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-02-22,"12:55 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to wait until the President finished up with his remarks on the budget before I came out. As you saw, he's -- a really good opportunity to sit down with his team. It's clearly been a busy day here at the White House again, so I'm going to kind of keep it quick and get to your questions. This morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President met with Secretary of State Tillerson. As you all know, Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Kelly will travel to Mexico City later today as one of their first foreign trips. It's significant that the President is sending the secretaries to Mexico so early in the administration.  It's symbolic of the meaningful relationship that our two nations have. These are important meetings regarding the President's agenda to improve the quality of lives for people of Mexico and the United States by combatting drug traffickers and finding ways to bolster both our economies through a broader relationship that promotes commerce and legal immigration. This is a very encouraging start to a working relationship with an incredible neighbor to the south. At this moment, the President has just wrapped up his discussions on the federal budget with some of the officials and staff who will be instrumental in the work to put this country back on a responsibly fiscal path. Joining the meeting were Reince Priebus, the Chief of Staff; Steve Bannon; Jared Kushner; Gary Cohn, the Director of the National Economic Council; Secretary Steve Mnuchin of the Department of Treasury; Director Mulvaney of the Office of Management and Budget; Russ Vought of the Office of Management and Budget; and Emma Doyle of Office of Management and Budget. As the President mentioned last week, we look forward to presenting our tax reform plan and providing much-needed tax reform and relief to the hardworking men and women of our nation. The President is going to restore and respect the American taxpayer by enabling them to keep more of their hard-earned money, and by making sure the federal government spends money more responsibly. After the lunch, the President will continue this important discussion with other members of the senior staff. Additionally, the Vice President today is in St. Louis to participate in listening sessions with American workers and employees of the Fabick Cat equipment and engineer* [engine] dealer, a 100-year-old family-owned and operated business. During his visit, the Vice President will discuss the economic comeback in store for our nation under the President's economic agenda and with small business owners and employees. The President has already made strides towards slashing redundant regulations through his executive actions, and we will work with Congress to enact further pro-growth legislation.  Back to the President's schedule. Later this afternoon, the President will participate in his standing legislative affairs strategy session. Our legislative affairs team is in constant contact with our counterparts on the Hill, keeping an open dialogue on all aspects of the President's agenda. Last week alone, more than 40 different senators and members of Congress visited the White House. On the Supreme Court front, so far Judge Gorsuch has met with 58 senators -- 36 Republicans and 22 Democrats -- and he has more meetings already on the books for next week when the Senate returns to session. We've been especially encouraged by the reception he's received from several senior Democrats, including Senators Feinstein, Tester, Durbin, and Gillibrand. Also on the confirmation front, multiple unions came out today for Alex Acosta, the President's nominee for Labor Secretary. Both the Laborers' International Union of North America and the International Union of Operating Engineers praised his distinguished career and pledged their support for his nomination. The legislative affairs team is using the congressional work period to coordinate with key coalitions in Congress. They are meeting with different groups in the House and Senate, including the staff of the Congressional Black Caucus, House and Senate leadership, and staff throughout various committees. We've used this work period as an opportunity to invite staffers from both sides of the aisle to come to the White House and discuss shared priorities and find common ground on the way forward. And we're not just reaching out to Capitol Hill, we've actively engaged with key leaders and policymakers around the country. It's critical to this administration that we gather input from states and from people throughout the country, rather than just leaders here in Washington. Looking ahead to tomorrow, the President will meet with a group of world-class business leaders to discuss specific actions he can take to remove barriers to job creation. These leaders, many of whom represent some of the country's largest manufacturers, will begin the day in working groups with the Vice President, Cabinet members and key aides of the President's staff. The working groups will engage in a deep-dive conversation on the attendees' specific areas of expertise. Topics of discussion include deregulation, tax and trade, training and the workforce of the future, and infrastructure Vice President Pence will be engaged with each of the groups. And after the groups conclude their discussion, the President's staff will compile the feedback and the President will sit down with the entire group for a listening session on some of their recommendations. As you can tell by the structure of the meeting, the President is expecting these interactions to lead to real action being taken by the administration. Creating a dynamic and booming economy that works for all Americans continues to be at the top of his domestic policy agenda. As a successful businessman himself, the President knows that if we're going to get the country back to work, we need to hear directly from job creators what is holding them back, and, where appropriate, take steps to remove the barriers. In his first month in office, the President has already taken numerous actions to boost job creation, and key economic indicators are showing that it's working. CEO and [consumer] confidence are up, the stock market continues to reach record highs, and the January numbers were strong. The meetings on Thursday will continue to build on that momentum. And with that, I'm glad to take some questions. Steve Holland. Q: Steve Holland is not here.  MR. SPICER: Sorry, Jeff Mason gets it. (Laughter.)  Q: Thank you, Sean. Can you give us an update on the administration's plans with regard to transgender bathrooms in schools? And can you confirm that there has been some disagreement between Secretary DeVos and the Attorney General on this issue? MR. SPICER: So I would expect further guidance to come out on that today. The President, as I said yesterday, is a firm believer in states' rights. When you look at the guidance that was issued under the Obama administration -- first of all, let's remember, to the best of my knowledge, that was stalled and never fully implemented. And I think there were various reasons for that -- several legal reasons and several procedural reasons. And so the Department of Education and the Department of Justice, both who jointly issued that guidance back during the Obama administration, are now working together again under a Trump administration, they've been reviewing the guidance that was signed, the basis by which it was put through. And I think there have been several areas of concern, both legal and procedural, that they have been discussing.  And I think where you might be hearing something is more on the timing and the wording of stuff. The conclusions, everybody in the administration is agreed upon. There is no daylight between anybody -- between the President, between any of the Secretaries. I think there has been some discussion between the timing of the issuance and recommendations, or between the exact wording.  But as far as the conclusions go, I've made this clear and the President has made it clear throughout the campaign that he is a firm believer in states' rights and that certain issues like this are not best dealt with at the federal level. Q: Sean, a report out today that some Cabinet Secretaries are bristling at what they see as the White House micromanaging staffing at the sub-Cabinet level. To what degree does the White House think that it should impose its hiring approvals on members of the sub-Cabinet? And is some of this at least partially driven by Cabinet Secretaries wanting to appoint people who might not necessarily be aligned with the President's thinking? MR. SPICER: Well, I mean, I think when you come to -- they're called political appointees for a reason. The idea is that people who come into this government should want to support and enact the President's agenda that he campaigned on with the American people. And I think one of the reasons that you see in recent polls the President -- people, even if they don't agree with the President, they give him high marks for following through on the promises that he's made to the American people and getting things done that he actually said, which is not always the case here in Washington. And I think that we want to make sure that the people who staff a Trump administration are committed to a Trump agenda, and that's -- so Cabinet Secretaries and other administrators and directors have broad discretion. But I think at the end of the day, no matter what position you have -- whether it's the lowest or the highest in the White House or in a department or agency -- we should be making sure that people who are coming in as appointees of the President support the President's agenda. And I think that's one thing -- this isn't about getting a job as a federal employee where you're subject to certain restrictions as to what you can and can't do as a benefit of being a federal employee. These are political appointees, and so I think that there is obviously -- we are going to ensure that people who are political appointees share the vision and agenda that the President campaigned on and is implementing. Q: And does the White House believe that it needs to have the final approval of these people or can you trust your Cabinet Secretaries to -- MR. SPICER: It's not a question of trust. It's a question of just making sure that we're all on the same page and committed to the same agenda that the President has set forth. This process is probably no different than we've seen in previous administrations. Cabinet Secretaries come to the President with recommendations on who they want, and it depends on the position, obviously.  But in certain cases, if they're going to fulfill a job that is a key area that the President had very specific goals to enact that he promised the American people, you want to make sure that the person that is fulfilling that job actually is committed to the agenda and the vision that the President set forth and promised the American people. And that's -- so there is -- that's something that we're always going to be making sure is in alignment. Q: And is this approval process in some way slowing down the appointment of crucial staffers? MR. SPICER: No. No, not at all. I don't think so. I think when you look across where we are and we track the number of folks that are in the pipeline, we're doing very, very well with getting all of these positions filled. And I think once in a while, you might hear of one or two people, but overall, generally speaking, I mentioned during the transition period how many members of the beachhead teams that we had, and I think we -- those members who are pointed through the beachhead process had 120 days. And they were there to allow basically a four-month process for Secretaries in the White House to make sure that people on a permanent basis could populate those positions. And that's what's happening. But make no mistake -- I mean, we were ahead of the curve on the beachhead teams. We were very clear with the landing teams during the transition. This has been a very methodical process that has seen from top to bottom through, and I think we're doing a phenomenal job of staffing the government. Margaret. Q: Thank you. Oh, which Margaret? MR. SPICER: Oh, lucky me. (Laughter.)  Q: Two Margarets. I'm going to take mine -- I've got a Bloomberg-y question for you. (Laughter.)  MR. SPICER: I've got a Sean-y answer for you. (Laughter.) Q: The President in the Roosevelt Room just said to us that, among other things, that the tax plan is nearly finalized but it can't be submitted until the healthcare plan statutorily or otherwise is, so we're doing the healthcare. So what I wanted to clarify was, is the White House doing a healthcare proposal, or was he talking about Congress and not the White House? Or is there a new plan? MR. SPICER: Well, obviously -- right. So obviously there's two vehicles -- reconciliation vehicles that -- FY17 -- I'm going to give you a Bloomberg-y answer. (Laughter.) The FY17 reconciliation, that was never completed because the budget wasn't finalized in the last Congress. And then you've got the 2018. I think we want to make sure -- look at the opportunities to work with Congress on Obamacare, utilizing the 2017, and then you could utilize the 2018 reconciliation and budget process to do tax reform. That's not -- and again, that's not prescriptive. I'm not -- but as far as why the President is saying it that way is because we've got that option available to us right now, and I think the President is committed to making sure that the promise that he made to the American people to repeal and replace Obamacare continues to be first and foremost, and then his tax plan. But it's not a ""we can walk and chew gum"" kind of thing. We can actually work with Congress and the leadership in both Houses.  Q: President Obama used to say that. Just to do the Bloomberg-y timeline, there's a few things that are going to happen then. There's going to be a budget plan that you guys are going to present on March 13th-ish. MR. SPICER: Ish. (Laughter.)  Q: There's going to be a healthcare -- this is where I got lost again -- something from him and something from them, and a tax reform plan afterwards? Is that the way it works? MR. SPICER: I don't want -- look, when we're ready to announce stuff -- but I think again, I think you've got Obamacare, the budget, and tax reform. It's going to be a very busy March and April for us. And we've been continuing to work with Congress to make sure that that's implemented.  Noah Bierman. Q: Does the President -- you were talking about fulfilling his promises. As you know, he promised during the campaign a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the country. There were a lot of people in his party who thought that was a very good proposal. Can you explain his evolution in backing down from that? And can you also say whether he regrets using that rhetoric, since it ended up hurting the court case? MR. SPICER: Well, again, I'd go back to the merits of the case and the order that gives him the authority to make that. U.S. Code 1182 is very clear. The President was very clear in his executive order that these were countries that we didn't have the proper vetting for when it came to ensuring the safety of Americans. That's what the executive order said. The authority is very clear to have done it. And I think that you're going to continue to see the President take the steps necessary to protect this country. That's why he's talked about fighting this on both fronts, making sure that we keep evolving through the court system on the existing EO, and then looking towards the next draft of the executive order that will continue to achieve the goal of protecting the American people. So that's where we are. That's what the order says. And then so I think we continue to feel confident that that's -- but it was crafted in a way that was very clear about the countries, and was not focused on anything else but the vetting requirements that we have to make sure that we know who's coming into this country and that they're here not to do us any harm. Q: But when talking about fulfilling his promises, can you explain why he decided to back down from that one? Because I know you differentiated this from that promise. MR. SPICER: I think he's made it very clear, Noah, from the beginning that this was a country-focused issue, a safety-focused issue, and that's why he issued it. I don't see anything other than that with reference to that. Debra Saunders. Q: Hi. The Oscars are Sunday night. Will the President be watching? If there's a Meryl Streep kind of moment, how do you think he'll react? And why -- if this has happened at other awards ceremonies, why do you think this happens? MR. SPICER: Why do I think what happens? (Laughter.)  Q: Actresses and actors like Meryl Streep.  MR. SPICER: I have no idea. It's a free country. I think Hollywood is known for being rather far to the left in its opinions. And I've got to be honest with you, I think the President will be hosting the Governors Ball that night. Mrs. Trump looks forward to putting on a phenomenal event, and the First Lady has put a lot of time into this event that's going to occur in welcoming our nation's governors to the Capitol. And I have a feeling that that's where the President and the First Lady are going to be focused on on Sunday night, and so we'll go from there. Q: Sean, the President is going to have a big audience next Tuesday in the joint address to Congress. Does he have a set of goals in mind for the speech? And do you think we're going to see some specific policy rollouts as part of that speech? MR. SPICER: I think that the speech is going to focus -- I mentioned this yesterday -- I think it's going to talk -- remind the American people what he's done already, and make sure that he explains to them not just because of a sense of accomplishment in moving this country forward, but because I think it's important for the American people to know that he was an agent of change, he came here to get things done, and he didn't waste any time. He's committed to keeping his word. And then I think he's going to lay out his vision and talk about things like education and healthcare and infrastructure, the problems that we face as a country, the violence in some of our inner cities, but also some of the solutions that we can act on and some of the partnerships that we can create. It's obviously still a work in progress. But I think it's going to look forward to where he wants to take this country and talk about working with Congress and other leaders throughout the country to get things done. But I think in the drafts that I've seen so far, it is going to be a very strong blueprint of where he wants to take this country.  In the past, I think a lot of presidents -- or some presidents, rather, have gotten into very detailed specifics. I think you're going to see him try to talk about policies in a broad sense of where he wants to take this country and what defining success is, what that goal means. But it's still a work in progress, and hopefully towards the end of the week -- Q: Is the tone going to be optimistic, sunny? MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think this is an opportunity for him to lay out a very positive vision for the nation and to really let America know where we can go and how we can get there, and the potential that we have as a nation. Anita. Q: Just piggybacking on that, and then I have another question. Will he -- I know past presidents, including President Obama, immediately hit the road after -- I know this isn't a State of the Union, but something like a State of the Union address to sell policies. And since you're saying it's more of a vision, does he anticipate doing -- going out -- MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think there will be some travel. I don't want to -- that's evolving right now. There's a lot of things that we're trying to look at. And I think as we look at the speech and some of the objectives and goals and vision that he's sharing, talk to him about potential places to go to highlight that. But I think you're going to see a fair amount of visits in the next few weeks to highlight some of the places that he wants to take them. Q: And then the other thing was, I've seen -- some members of Congress were here last week. There's the legislative meeting today. It feels as if we haven't seen as many executive actions -- or executive orders. I know we have the one -- vetting one coming out this week. Are we in a different phase now that he's sort of done the executive orders that he wants to do -- MR. SPICER: No. Q: -- and we're going to legislation? MR. SPICER: We have several that are in the pipeline. And part of it is just -- these days are focused with these meetings and getting things done and trying to plan ahead. And so as we see fit and as the implementation process of a lot of these goes through the process, we'll have future -- we'll have plenty more. But --  Q: It does seem that there's more legislative emphasis right now. MR. SPICER: Well, it's both. And I think part of this is as we work through Congress, Anita, these are big things, right? We're talking about fundamental tax reform -- something that hasn't happened in our nation since 1986. The repeal and replacement of Obamacare, which was mammoth. And I think part of this is that those things take time. He's got a joint address on Tuesday. There's a lot of things that are happening, and therefore we need to kind of make sure that we appropriately use the schedule. But I can assure you that if you've missed executive orders, you're going to see a bunch --  Q: (Inaudible.)  MR. SPICER: (Laughter.) I know. I just want to make sure you know. Jonathan Karl. Q: I want to ask you about the town halls, and we're hearing about Obamacare. The President referred to ""so-called angry crowds"" at these town halls. Is he suggesting this is manufactured anger, that this is not real anger and real concern? MR. SPICER: Thanks. I think there's a hybrid there. I think some people are clearly upset. But there is a bit of professional protestor, manufactured base in there. But obviously there are people that are upset. But I also think that when you look at some of these districts and some of these things, that it is not a representation of a member's district or -- it is a loud group, small group of people disrupting something, in many cases, for media attention. No offense. It's just -- I think that necessarily -- just because they're loud doesn't necessarily mean that there are many. And I think in a lot of cases that's what you're seeing.  Q: Does the President doubt that there is real anger -- MR. SPICER: No, I just said that. Q: -- and real concern out there beyond just a few loud agitators, that there's real concern that people may lose their healthcare? MR. SPICER: But see, I think that that's a false narrative. And I don't -- the President has been very clear. Look, you have to look at what our healthcare system is right now. In so many counties around our nation, we've gone down to one provider. That's not choice. That's not access.  And then they're going in a lot of cases and they're saying, we're not taking Medicaid, we're not taking TRICARE, we're not taking the insurance you used to have; the doctor that you used to have isn't participating anymore. And, oh, by the way, states like Arizona, you've got over 100 percent increase in premiums -- 112 [percent] I think was the number there. In many states, it's double, triple -- double-digit.  And I think that the idea that we have to remember is that the American people got sold the Affordable Care Act -- it's neither affordable or accessible. They're losing their coverage and premiums are spiking. And so if people are truly worried about losing their coverage, they should be applauding the President's action for wanting to make sure that we put a system in place that does what they were supposed to have been promised a while back.  And I think that's -- that's what I think is missing from this dialogue. I've seen some folks that were protesting in some of these things saying, I lost -- I'm on Obamacare, I'm going to lose my thing. And when they were asked how old they were, they were, oh, I'm 71, 72. Well, they're not on Obamacare. -- they're on Medicaid. Q: So you think you're making it up? MR. SPICER: No, not they're making it up. But what I'm getting at it is I think that there is a lot of blurring of the facts. And the reality is that some people aren't on Obamacare. They're on an employer-based system. They're on Medicaid. They're receiving their benefits through Medicare because of their age. And so they're in -- nothing. They have no problems.  But I think in other cases, people are now being told that the plan that they're on is unsustainable; that these carriers throughout the country -- I mean, you just look at them, over and over again pulling out of the exchanges. The reality is, is that they are losing their healthcare, but they're losing it under Obamacare because the exchanges are collapsing on themselves. Carriers are pulling out. Premiums are going up. And access is going down. So the President's plan is actually going to do exactly what they were promised eight years ago and didn't get. So for those who are worried, the answer is: Help is on the way. Q: But what is the plan? We haven't seen what he's going to replace it with. MR. SPICER: First, as the President made clear, we're going to have that out in the next couple weeks. He's working on it. But the goal, Jonathan, is this got jammed through a Democratic Congress, and then they told us you could read it after we get it passed. So taking our time, getting this right to achieve the goals that we set forth is probably the right thing to do, considering the experience that we had the last time. Hallie. Q: Sean, two questions for you. The issue of transgender bathrooms wasn't one we heard a lot about from the President during the campaign. He said at one point, Caitlyn Jenner could use whichever bathroom she wanted to at Trump Tower. So why is this now a priority for the administration 40 days into office? MR. SPICER: It's not a priority. I think there's a case --  Q: But It's one of the first things -- MR. SPICER: But let me answer the question. It's not a priority. There is a case pending in the Supreme Court in which we have to decide whether or not to continue to issue guidance to the Court. It's dictated by that. The Obama administration had issued joint guidance from the Department of Education and the Department of Justice. We now have to decide whether or not this administration wants to continue that track that they were on. It's plain and simple. If we don't -- but there are problems, both in the legal and process way, in which that guidance was issued. And so it's incumbent upon us to actually follow the law and to recognize that Title IX never talked about this. It was enacted in 1972. There was no discussion of this back then. And to assume certain elements of the law were thought of back then with respect to this would be completely preposterous. Q: And to be clear, Secretary DeVos is onboard with this? MR. SPICER: Yes, 100 percent. Thank you. Q: Sean, that was actually a clarification. The second question is on Mexico. The Secretary of State's trip that is tonight along with Secretary Kelly, obviously there have been tensions, right, between the Mexican President and President Trump. Is this a clean-up job for the Secretary of State? MR. SPICER: No. I think that President Pe—Åa Nieto and President Trump spoke -- again, the foreign ministers had several contacts with our staff. I would argue that we have a very healthy and robust relationship with the Mexican government and Mexican officials, and I think they would echo that same sentiment. President Pe—Åa Nieto has echoed that as well. But I think the relationship with Mexico is phenomenal right now, and I think there's an unbelievable and robust dialogue between our two nations. Margaret, and then I'll get you. Q: On Syria, General Votel indicated today that the U.S. needs to take a larger share of the burden and perhaps send troops to Syria. Has the President discussed this with his national security team? And when does he -- MR. SPICER: I'm going to refer you back to DOD on that. I would just argue that I think that you've seen the President talk about safe harbors in Syria with several foreign leaders who have shared his --  Q: Safe havens. MR. SPICER: Safe havens, thank you. And that is an area at the top of the President's foreign policy agenda that he has continued to talk to leaders, especially in the Middle east, about, trying to make sure that we deal with that issue in that area right now. But I'm not going to get ahead of the DOD on this. And then when they have recommendations, they'll make them forward to us. Q: Is there an NSC -- has the President spoken to --  MR. SPICER: Look, I will -- if I have an update, I'll give it to you tomorrow. Go ahead. Q: President Trump and the Canadian Minister wants the U.S. and Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs. Can you talk a little bit about how the council is growing and transpiring? What's the status of it? MR. SPICER: I think staff is beginning to implement the President's agenda. It occurred, what, six, seven days ago. And so it's starting to work through the process and we'll have further updates as it goes forward. But I know that he continues to be in touch with Prime Minister Trudeau, and our staff continues to work on the back end to make this happen. Zeke. Q: Thanks, Sean. I have two questions for you. One, earlier in your conversation with Jon, does the White House not have confidence in its Cabinet Secretaries if it's looking sort of over their shoulders? Does the White House not -- does the President not trust his Cabinet Secretaries, appointees and agency administrators to staff -- to find people who agree with the President's agenda? MR. SPICER: No, not at all. I think there's a big difference. The President named these folks because they're unbelievably qualified individuals. Part of it, though, is that you're staffing major departments and I think we've got somewhere in the area of 5,000 positions to fill. And when you're filtering through a good number of people, I don't even think the Secretaries, at some degree, depending on the department, have a full background on some of these individuals. And so as they get pumped through the pipeline, there are questions. And, again, there are areas that are of key priority to the President that he campaigned on. And I think that when he wants to make sure that certain of those individuals who are going to be overseeing key priorities that he promised the American people have somebody who is not only qualified but agrees with and shares the President's vision to fix whatever problem that was or fulfill whatever vision that he articulated. But I think that that -- I mean, it would almost be malpractice not to do that. To allow people to fill a job, a political appointee job, who don't share the vision and agenda of the President of the United States would almost be -- I mean, it would be silly on its face to suggest this. I don't think there's any administration in past history that would literally, willingly, take on somebody who was adamantly opposed or spoke out specifically against what the President was seeking to do, and then have them fulfill a job to carry out that mission. It just -- it doesn't seem as though it makes any sense. Yes. Q: Second thing real quick. We're coming up on a week away from the deadline the President ordered for his review of the counter-ISIS strategy. What's the status of that review? The President tweeted over the weekend that he was meeting with a bunch of generals. MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: Is that regarding that review? MR. SPICER: I think General Dunford and Secretary Mattis have begun providing him updates on that. I know that the new National Security Advisor is getting brought into that process and continuing to do updates, so we'll have further updates. But the team has been working on it since the President issued the guidance.  Yes. Q: As far as the second executive order is concerned, what is the White House doing differently in terms of consulting with various departments to make certain that this second executive order passes constitutional scrutiny? MR. SPICER: Well, I think we've done a few things. One is, I think we've been very clear about understanding what the court said in trying to tailor that specifically while achieving the same goals of keeping America safe and ensuring that people don't come into this country that seek to do us harm. That's number one. Number two is, we continue -- and that order is basically completed. I think what we're now doing is working with the various agencies and departments to make sure that the implementation of that is done in an extremely smooth way. So we have looked at it from both a process standpoint, as well as a legal standpoint. And I think it's achieving the goals. But again, I would also mention that, on the merits, I believe that the first order did just that. It was written in a way -- and I think ultimately we will continue to prevail on that -- because it is written in a way that is clear and consistent with U.S. code and the authority that the President has to protect the nation. Katie. Q: Sean -- Q: No matter what happens, as it relates to the second executive order, it's almost likely to face a legal challenge. MR. SPICER: Sure.  Q: Are you concerned that the President's prior remarks as it relates to the judiciary is going to allow him to get a fair hearing by the judicial branch as it relates to the second executive order? MR. SPICER: Yeah, absolutely. I think that --  Q: Why do you say that? MR. SPICER: Because I think that you've seen it happen in the Massachusetts case. I mean, at the end of the day, you look at the law and what the order does. And I think, again, you may have -- in the case of the 9th Circuit, we continue to disagree with that. I think the President has pointed out you don't have to be that high up in grade school to recognize what the code says, what the authority that is granted to him, and then what the order does. I think the things that they brought out in that order -- in one of the cases, they suggested there have been no people that have entered within the seven countries. And a quick cursory look found upwards of close to 20 people that had come in. So some of the basis for which they decided the case on doesn't actually pass muster. And I think any other judge or judges that look at that order or the one that will be put forward will come to the same conclusion. Katie. Q: Sean, I wanted to ask about the President's budget priorities. What specifically is the President increasing spending on? Where is he decreasing spending? And how much money specifically is he asking for the 5,000 new Border Patrol agents he's asked for? MR. SPICER: So I'm going to refer you back to Margaret's question, and then we'll have something in mid-March as we put that out. But I'm not going to get ahead of Director Mulvaney. Q: (Inaudible.) MR. SPICER: No, I mean, it's not -- look, he just had a meeting where he's continued to work that out. They're providing him back-and-forth. That's the idea of crafting this budget. And until we put it out on paper, I don't want to get ahead of --  Q: Sean, can I follow up on Mexico? MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: Thank you very much. Back to Mexico -- Videgaray and many officials have said this morning that they're not going to accept the directives that were put out by the White House and by DHS yesterday, and they may not take anyone that's not a Mexican immigrant. What are you guys doing to do with those people that Mexico will not accept? MR. SPICER: I think Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Kelly are going to have a great discussion down there, and to walk through the implementation of the executive order. But I feel very confident that any country who has a citizen that comes into this country, and that we send back, we'll make sure that they comply with this. David. Q: Two questions about immigration. One, the President has talked a number of times about millions of illegal immigrants casting votes during the election, in his mind. You guys have promised to look into that. It seems like there was no mention of that in any of these directives, to look for these immigrants. Does the President still believe this is a national security problem?  MR. SPICER: Yeah, and Vice President Pence will lead a task force on this. Q: Where would we stand on that, though? MR. SPICER: He named a task force, and the Vice President is starting to gather names and individuals to be part of it. Q: On the other question I had about the DACA program, yesterday you suggested, well, we have to go after hardened criminals and major national security threats first. But during the campaign, the President talked about DACA as being an unconstitutional executive amnesty. Does he still think it was an unconstitutional use of President Obama's powers? And if so, does he plan --  MR. SPICER: I think -- yeah, I think -- and I said this yesterday: The President is very clear about his priorities with respect to immigration. Yesterday was focused on going after people who are a concern -- a public safety concern. And we're going to walk through this very -- Q: -- unconstitutional? MR. SPICER: We will get back to you on that. Right now the focus is on keeping the country safe and making sure that we walk through. Shane. Q: I want to ask on immigration, as well. Given all of the push on deporting illegal immigrants, I wanted to see if this White House and President Trump have any interest in curtailing legal immigration going forward. MR. SPICER: Again, we got to look at this from a priority level. Right now there's millions of people in this country that are in the country illegally. I think the focus continues to be that 800,000 or 900,000 that have already had an order to have them removed and get them processed through in a way that continues to keep America safe. Legal immigration, obviously, is a completely separate subject, and that includes visa reform and all that other stuff. The President has talked about that. He's talked about it with business leaders -- H-1B visas, et cetera. You're going to see more of that coming. But I think there is a prioritization of how we deal with immigration -- both illegal and then legal. And we'll have more on that later. I got to run. Thank you, guys, very much. We'll see you tomorrow. Take care. END 1:30 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-02-23,"2:58 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: I was thinking about not doing a briefing today, and then I saw Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon give that talk and I thought they were infringing on my ratings, so we figured we had to do something to keep up our record. It's been another busy day today. This morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President welcomed some of the world's top business and manufacturing leaders to the White House to continue the administration's effort to engage with the private sector to create jobs and expand opportunities for America's workers. The 24 CEOs spent the morning in working sessions with the Vice President, Cabinet members and key aides, and came together with the President to brief him on their discussions and recommendations. The group discussed the need to roll back burdensome regulations that are stifling economic growth. The CEOs thanked the President for the actions that he's already taken to address the issues, and the President pledged to do even more, both through the executive branch and by working with Congress to pass legislation that will help further economic growth and job creation. The business leaders recommended that the administration take a multifaceted approach to tax and trade policies, including tax reform, toward which Secretary Mnuchin said that progress is continuing to be made. The President committed to working to lower taxes and level the playing field with other countries when it comes to trade and taxation. The group held a lengthy discussion about the need to invest in the American worker to prepare for the manufacturing jobs of the future, especially the key role of vocational schools in training the workforce of the 21st century. The CEOs and administration officials agreed that public-private partnerships will be the cornerstone of a robust plan to rebuild the nation's crumbling infrastructure. The President committed to streamlining a permitting process that is holding back so many key projects.  At the end of the discussion, the group expressed their excitement for having a true partner in economic growth in the White House, and Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Dow Chemical, even said that this is probably the most pro-business administration since the Founding Fathers. The President conveyed his intention to assemble the industry leaders on a regular basis to discuss progress towards these important goals. A full list of the participants is available. This afternoon, the President spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau by phone. We'll have a readout on that call soon. Right now, many of you just came from the President, who is involved in another listening session with leaders in the fight against domestic and international human trafficking, including representatives from International Justice Mission and United Way. Their expertise will be invaluable to the President as he engages with members of Congress to raise awareness about, and push through, legislation aimed at preventing all forms of the horrific and unacceptable practice of the buying and selling of human lives. Human trafficking is a dire problem, both domestically and internationally. And solving this epidemic is a huge priority for the President. Dedicated men and women from across the federal government have focused on this for some time, and the President is committed to continue working with these organizations and departments. A participant list for this listening session is also going to be available. The President this evening will attend a dinner with the Business Council.  Today in Mexico, Secretaries Tillerson and Kelly had productive meetings at the Cabinet level with officials from the Mexican government. They were forward-looking meetings focused on finding common-ground ways to advance both of our countries' security and economic wellbeing. Both sides had a candid discussion on the breadth of challenges and opportunities as part of the U.S.-Mexico relationship. The conversation covered a full range of bilateral issues, including energy, legal migration, security, education exchanges, and people-to-people ties. The parties also reiterated our joint commitment to maintaining law and order at our shared border by stopping potential terrorists and dismantling the transnational criminal networks that are moving drugs and people into the United States. Under this President there is no mistaking that rule of law matters along both sides of our border. Both Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Kelly are meeting with President Pe—Åa Nieto this afternoon. That will be a continuation of the productive dialogue that is setting our two countries down a pathway to greater security and long-term prosperity. Looking ahead to our upcoming schedule, tomorrow the President will welcome President of Peru for a working-level visit. The President of Peru is in town for a separate visit and requested a meeting with the President. There will be a spray at the top of that. Further guidance will be provided later today. The President will also speak at CPAC tomorrow. I know the President is looking forward to addressing this group of conservative-committed individuals. Our nation's governors are starting to gather in Washington this week for a meeting of the National Governors Association. The President and the First Lady will welcome the governors to the White House on Sunday evening. The Vice President and members of the Cabinet will also be in attendance. While the governors are in town, they will be meeting with members of the Cabinet, White House staff, and other Secretaries including Kelly, Price, and Secretary Chao have also set up a series of meetings.  The President, Vice President, and senior White House staff will also participate in a portion of the business session of NGA's winter meeting that takes place on Monday morning. Next week, of course, the President will give a joint session address before both Houses of Congress. He's currently working closely with the speechwriting team on presenting his vision to Congress and the American people. I've got a few updates that I want to just -- as we're now a few days out. The theme of the address will be the renewal of the American spirit. The address will particularly focus on public safety, including defense, increased border security, taking care of our veterans, and then economic opportunity, including education, job training, healthcare reform, jobs, and tax and regulatory reform. With that, I'd be glad to take a few of your questions.  Q: Two questions. First, the White House said previously that that travel ban was pushed quickly out of necessity for national security, and now we're hearing there's these repeated delays while the new one is being drafted. How do we reconcile those two talking points? That's question one. And then secondly, the President said today that the deportations taking place under his watch are a military operation. Secretary Kelly said the military won't be involved in deportations. Did the President misspeak? MR. SPICER: So I'll take the latter first. The President was using that as an adjective. It's happening with precision, and in a manner in which it's being done very, very clearly.  I think we've made it clear in the past, and Secretary Kelly reiterated it, what kind of operation this was. But the President was clearly describing the manner in which this was being done. And so just to be clear on his use of that phrase. And I think the way it's being done, by all accounts, is being done with very much a high degree of precision and a flawless manner in terms of making sure that the orders are carried out, and it's done in a very streamlined and efficient manner. I'm sorry, the first part was? Q: The first one was about the travel ban. MR. SPICER: Yeah. And I think, look, we have made it very clear that we believe that the first one was done in compliance with U.S. code and the authority granted to the President. This time, the order is finalized. What we are doing is now in the implementation phase of working with the respective departments and agencies to make sure that when we execute this, it's done in a manner that's flawless. And so it's not a question of delaying, it's a question of getting it right. We've taken the Court's opinions and concerns into consideration, but the order is finalized. It's now awaiting implementation. What we want to do is make sure that we're working through the departments and agencies so that any concerns or questions are handled on the front end. But we are acting with appropriate haste and diligence to make sure that the order is done in an appropriate manner. Q: I want to ask you about a comment that the Treasury Secretary made today. He was asked if we should assume that the tax plan that the President is about to roll out will take effect in 2018. He said, and I'm quoting, ""I think we're looking at that."" So my question to you is, would the President accept a tax proposal that deals with the timeline of implementation in 2018 but not 2017? MR. SPICER: So, Secretary Mnuchin also made it very clear that his goal is to have this wrapped up by August and implemented. The question is, or what you're referring to is what year it actually takes place? Q: Right. MR. SPICER: Right, so whether it's retroactive to tax year 2017 or fiscal year '17. And I think as the details get --  Q: (Inaudible.) MR. SPICER: Yeah, we'll have more details on that as it moves forward. I think there's two issues -- fiscal year '17 and calendar year '17. And, for taxpayers, it's obviously calendar year 2017 that they're probably most concerned with, and I think the President, as we work with Congress, will have those details to be able to flush out. I want to go to our first Skype seat of the day. Neil Vigdor with Hearst Connecticut Media Group. Q: Good afternoon, Sean. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. Connecticut's governor directed police chiefs across the state Wednesday to avoid taking any special action against undocumented immigrants, including honoring immigration detainer requests from ICE. What will the repercussions be for this state in terms of federal funding it receives from the Trump administration? And secondly, does the President's executive order on sanctuary cities apply to those that are undeclared sanctuary cities? MR. SPICER: Well, Neil, I think there's a couple things. The idea that Governor Malloy would not want the law followed as enacted by Congress or by the Connecticut legislature in any fashion seems to be concerning, right? Whether you're a governor or mayor or the President, laws are passed in this country and we expect people and our lawmakers and our law enforcement agencies to follow and adhere to the laws as passed by the appropriate level of government. So it's obviously concerning, I think, and it's troubling that that's the message that he would send to his people and to other governors. Because we are a nation of laws, and I think that people need to understand that whether it's the laws that he passes as the Governor of Connecticut or the laws that are passed through Congress and signed by the President, there's a reason that our democracy works. It's because the people speak, our representatives at every level pass a law, and the executive in that particular branch of government signs or vetoes it, and then we live by those rules. And the idea that you can decide which laws to agree or not to agree with, or follow or not follow, undermines our entire rule of law. And so I would suggest that that is not a great sign to be sending to the people of Connecticut and the people of this country, that a particular governor chooses not to follow the duly-passed laws of this nation.  With respect to sanctuary cities, I think this is an area that the American people by huge amounts support. They recognize their tax dollars shouldn't be spent supporting programs and activities to which people are not entitled to. And so I think the President has been very clear on this -- that if you are a sanctuary city, declared or undeclared, if you are providing benefits or services, we are going to do everything we can to respect taxpayers and ensure that your states follow the law. April. Q: Sean, on the bathroom issue, there was a different comment from the President about, you know, if people like Caitlyn Jenner wanted to use this bathroom in Trump Tower, she could now. What's happened? MR. SPICER: No, I think that's -- so just to be clear, the President was asked -- at one point Caitlyn Jenner was in Trump Tower, and he said, that's great. That's consistent with everything he's said. It's a states' rights issue. And that's entirely what he believes -- that if a state wants to pass a law or rule, or an organization wants to do something in compliance with the state rule, that's their right. But it shouldn't be the federal government getting in the way of this.  I mean, if you look at this, the law that was passed in 1972 did not contemplate or consider this issue. Number two, the procedure for this guidance letter that was done through the Obama administration was not properly followed. There was no comment period. There was no input from parents, teachers, students or administrators. None.  So if we think about how this was implemented last administration, there was zero input, there was zero comment period offered. Teachers and students never had any say in how this was implemented. Number three, there's a reason that the Texas court had this matter enjoined. It's because it didn't follow the law and it had procedural problems. Four, as I mentioned, it's a states' rights issue. And then five is, I think that we do have to recognize that children do enjoy rights, from anti-bullying statutes that are in almost every state, and that there's a difference between being compassionate for individuals and children who are struggling with something and wanting to make sure they're protected, and how it's being done. And I think that the President has a big heart, as we've talked about in a lot of other issues, and there's a big difference. Personally, he addressed this issue when it came up with respect to one of his properties. But he also believes that that's not a federal government issue. It's an issue left to the states, and it's an issue that -- I mean, there's a reason in August of last year that the court enjoined this, because it hadn't followed the law and it hadn't -- the procedure, the comment period and the solicitation of opinions and ideas wasn't followed. It was jammed down the process. And so we're actually following the law on this one, and I think that's the way it's supposed to be done. John. Q: If I could just follow on what April said. The Human Rights Campaign --  Q: I wasn't finished, I'm sorry.  Q: Well, I'm following on your question. Let me follow -- Q: I understand that, but -- MR. SPICER: Why don't we let April follow on and then we'll get to John, Kristen and Brian.  Q: Yeah. So I have one on -- I have something on another issue really fast, then John can do that. On the HBCU executive order, we understand the executive order that's coming out sometime later this month, it's supposed to open -- you're working out issues of opening an office specifically to take the HBCU initiative out of the Department of Education and bring it directly under the purview of the White House. Who will be heading that? Have you figured that out? Have you also figured out how you will build that office out? Because from what I understand, that is one of the big pieces of this. MR. SPICER: Well, respectfully, that's why it hasn't been issued yet. We're working it through the process. Obviously, that is something that we're committed to getting done by the end of Black History Month. So our days are numbered, but there's a commitment by the President and the staff to really focus on this issue and give it the proper respect that it deserves. So if you'll bear with us a couple more days, I promise you we'll have more to say on that. Q: So it will be a department with the full --  MR. SPICER: No, no, I just want to be clear, I'm not going to get into the details. Sort of my blanket statement on non-issued executive orders. But I do know that there is a commitment by the President and the staff that he has been very clear with us that he wants that done by the end of this month for obvious reasons. Now John. Q: Let me get back to where we were. The Human Rights Campaign, in responding to rescinding the guidance last night, said that this is not a states' rights issue, it's a civil rights issue, and therefore is in the purview of the federal government. Do you disagree that this a civil rights issue? MR. SPICER: It's not a -- it's a question of where it's appropriately addressed. And I think there's a reason -- like, we've got to remember, this guidance was enjoined last August by a court. It hasn't been enforced. There was no comment period by anyone -- by the Human Rights Campaign, by teachers, parents, students. Nobody had any input of this. And it seems to me a little interesting that if this was any other issue, people would be crying foul that the process wasn't followed. The reality is, is that when you look at Title IX, it was enacted in 1972. The idea that this was even contemplated at that is preposterous on its face. But that doesn't mean that the President -- the President obviously understands the issue and the challenges that especially young children face. He just believes that this is a state issue that needs to be addressed by states, as he does with a lot of other issues that we've talked about. And so this is -- we are a states' rights party. The President on a lot of issues believes in these various issues being states' rights. I don't see why this would be any different. And again, if you go through it, it's not just -- it's how the guidance was issued, it's the legal basis on which it was ordered. It fell short on a lot of stuff. It wasn't us that did this; it was the court that stepped in and said that they hadn't followed the procedure of the law back in August of last year and enjoin the case. Q: I understand all that, I'm just wondering if -- does the White House disagree with the position that this is a civil right? MR. SPICER: Well, I think it's not a question of whether it's a civil right, it's where is it appropriately addressed. And as I noted, it's appropriately addressed at the state level. Kelly. Q: Can I follow on that? Sean, does the President believe, personally believe that any student who is transgender should be able to use the bathroom of their choice? His personal belief? MR. SPICER: The President believes it's a states' rights issue. And he's not going to get into determining -- I understand what you're asking, Kelly. And I think that, as April pointed out, when the issue came to one of his own properties he was very clear. But again, what he doesn't want to do is force his issues or beliefs down -- he believes it's a states' rights issue -- Q: But the public may want to know where the President is on this issue. MR. SPICER: I understand that, and I think that he is very sympathetic to children who deal with that and that this is up to states and schools within a particular district to address how they want to accommodate that, and not sort of be prescriptive from Washington. That's what the President believes. Zeke. Q: Thanks, Sean. You mentioned that this order was enjoined by a court and there was criticism about the process. That exact same criticism has been levied on the administration's first executive order, on the travel ban. I mean, can you help us square the circle here? Why are you relying on that same ""enjoined by a federal court"" criticism of the process for one but not the other? MR. SPICER: Well, I think there's a big difference. There's no way that you can read Title IX from 1972 -- anybody -- and say that that was even contemplated back then. It just -- there's nobody that is possibly suggesting that the law that was passed in 1972 did that. Number two, there was zero comment period put forward on this guidance, which is in violation of how it was executed, okay? And so there's a big difference -- hold on, hold, on let me answer the question, Zeke. There is also a strong reading when you read 1182 U.S. Code that it is very clear that the President does have the authority. So they are very much apples and oranges issue. One, it's very clear that the President is told by Congress in U.S. code that he has the authority to do what's necessary to protect the American people. And there's no way that anybody above a fifth grade reading level could interpret that different. There is a difference between looking at a statute from 1972 and saying that something was complicated back then.  Not only that -- again, it's a multifaceted thing. When you look at how the guidance was issued, there was a zero comment period. Nobody was able to weigh in on that situation back then. And so when you're talking about forcing schools to make a huge accommodation from the federal level, and schools, parents, teachers, kids were not able to have any input in that decision from Washington, I think it's a very, very clear difference.  John Gizzi.  Q: Thank you, Sean. Just going back two weeks, in a story that got relatively little attention at the time -- Chuck Cooper, a very distinguished lawyer, asked that his name be withdrawn when he was on the periphery of being named U.S. Solicitor General. So my question is a two-parter. First, can you confirm or deny the administration is now vetting Mr. Miguel Estrada, who was a former nominee for the Court of Appeals, as Solicitor General before the visa delay case gets to the Supreme Court? And second, Mr. Cooper said that he did not want to go through the same experience that Jeff Sessions, his good friend, did when he had the confirmation hearings and the vote in the Senate. Does that make the President a little bit discouraged about getting the nominees he wants for some very important positions? MR. SPICER: Well, thanks, John. And I'd say - on the first part, as you know -- and I'll give you the same answer we give executive orders -- we don't comment on personnel decisions until they're made, until they're finalized. So I've got nothing for that. On the second part, what I would say is that the President is very confident we have a deep bench of folks who -- during the transition, we talked about this -- a number of people who have expressed a huge interest in joining the President in fulfilling this agenda. And that list is robust and long. However, that being said, I think for folks who have to go through the Senate confirmation and to watch what has happened to some of these fine individuals -- the delay tactics, the tearing apart of their personal lives -- it is discouraging for some of these people, I think, in terms of Mr. Cooper and others who are looking at the process saying, I would like to be part of this administration, help fulfill this vision and this agenda, but this is what I'm going to have go through. So while this is somewhat of an isolated case, I definitely understand what he's talking about here. And I think those are few and far between, but I think that when you realize what is happening largely at the expense of Senate Democrats, in terms of dragging these people through a very, very delayed and arduous process for purely political points, I think that there are some people who could look at the process and potentially say I don't want to serve. Luckily, we've not come to that beyond a handful of folks. Largely, people have huge desire and are willing to make great sacrifice -- both financially and personally -- to serve in the administration because I think they understand what potential change this President is bringing to this country and to the city. But I understand his point. Q: This morning, the President talked about, as he often does when he talks about immigrants, he talks about really bad dudes.  MR. SPICER: Yeah. Q: You talked about precision. The Homeland Security Secretary this morning insisted there won't be mass deportation.  MR. SPICER: Right.  Q: Is it the President's intent or desire, as some advocates worry, that people who are here illegally with something as simple as a traffic violation, that those people will be subject to deportation? Yes or no? MR. SPICER: Well, I think everybody who is in this country for obvious reasons -- if you overstay a visa, if you commit a crime, you can't -- by the very nature of you not being legal, you can be subject to deportation. That's by definition. Being in this country is a privilege, not a right, if you are a visitor. And I think we have a right to make sure that the people who are in this country are here for good and peaceful processes.  And as I've said over and over again, there is a big difference. The President recognizes that there are millions of people in the country who are not here legally, and that we have to have a very systematic and pragmatic and methodical process of going through those individuals to make sure that the people who pose a threat to public safety or have a criminal record are the first that are gone. What we've done -- just to be clear -- is to untie the hands of ICE and Border Patrol agents and say, your job is to enforce the law -- first and foremost to figure out who poses a threat to us. But in the previous administration their hands had been tied. There was exception after exception after exception. And the fact of the matter is, is that we have to -- we are a nation of laws, and we have to have a system of legal immigration that is respected. So I'm not going to be prescriptive in terms of what ICE's job is. But needless to say, their job and their mission is to protect the country and to enforce our borders and our immigration laws. And the President has basically instructed them to carry out their mission. And so the priorities, as we've discussed over and over and over again, is to do that is in accordance with the law but also prioritizes those people that pose a threat. I'm going to go to Roby Brock from the Talk Business & Politics in -- where is he from? Arkansas.  Q: Thanks, Sean. Roby Brock with Talk Business & Politics here in Arkansas, the home of the rowdiest town halls in the nation.  I have a question on medical marijuana. Our state voters passed a medical marijuana amendment in November. Now we're in conflict with federal law, as many other states are. The Obama administration kind of chose not to strictly enforce those federal marijuana laws. My question to you is: With Jeff Sessions over at the Department of Justice as AG, what's going to be the Trump administration's position on marijuana legalization where it's in a state-federal conflict like this? MR. SPICER: Thanks, Roby. There's two distinct issues here: medical marijuana and recreational marijuana.  I think medical marijuana, I've said before that the President understands the pain and suffering that many people go through who are facing especially terminal diseases and the comfort that some of these drugs, including medical marijuana, can bring to them. And that's one that Congress, through a rider in 2011 -- looking for a little help -- I think put in an appropriations bill saying the Department of Justice wouldn't be funded to go after those folks.  There is a big difference between that and recreational marijuana. And I think that when you see something like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country, the last thing that we should be doing is encouraging people. There is still a federal law that we need to abide by in terms of the medical -- when it comes to recreational marijuana and other drugs of that nature.  So I think there's a big difference between medical marijuana, which states have a -- the states where it's allowed, in accordance with the appropriations rider, have set forth a process to administer and regulate that usage, versus recreational marijuana. That's a very, very different subject. Shannon. Q: What does that mean in terms of policy? A follow-up, Sean. What does that mean in terms of policy? MR. SPICER: Shannon. Glenn, this isn't a TV program. We're going to -- Q: What is the Justice Department going to do? MR. SPICER: Okay, you don't get to just yell out questions. We're going to raise our hands like big boys and girls. Q: Why don't you answer the question, though? MR. SPICER: Because it's not your job to just yell out questions.  Shannon, please go. Q: Okay. Well, first, on the manufacturing summit, was the AFL-CIO invited? And then, yeah, I did want to follow up on this medical marijuana question. So is the federal government then going to take some sort of action around this recreational marijuana in some of these states? MR. SPICER: Well, I think that's a question for the Department of Justice. I do believe that you'll see greater enforcement of it. Because again, there's a big difference between the medical use which Congress has, through an appropriations rider in 2014, made very clear what their intent was in terms of how the Department of Justice would handle that issue. That's very different than the recreational use, which is something the Department of Justice I think will be further looking into.  I'm sorry, Shannon, what was the first part? Q: Was the AFL-CIO invited to the manufacturing meeting today with the CFOs? Because they are part of this manufacturing -- MR. SPICER: Right. I think this was just focused on people who actually -- they were not, I don't believe, part of this one. As you know, that we've had union representation at other meetings. I think this was specifically for people who are hiring people and the impediments that they're having to create additional jobs, hire more people. And obviously, while the President values their opinion -- and that's why they've been involved in some of the past -- this was specifically a manufacturing -- people who hire people, who manufacture, who grow the economy, who grow jobs. And that is a vastly different situation. Andrei. Q: I specifically sat here next to John to have -- MR. SPICER: One can see -- Q: You know me. (Laughter.) Thank you. A question on Russia. Secretary Tillerson and General Dunford have had meetings with their Russian counterparts. Is the President pleased with the results of the meetings? MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: And what comes next? MR. SPICER: Yeah, both of them had an opportunity to meet with their counterparts in different locations, ironically on the same day. I believe that was yesterday. And they both had very, very productive discussions. The President was very pleased with the outcome of that, and so I would refer you back to both General Dunford and Secretary Tillerson on those.  Q: You started discussing the where and when for the summit for the leaders meeting? MR. SPICER: I don't have any updates on that, but I'll look into that.  Cecilia. Q: Sean, I just want to follow up. I want to clarify, make sure I understand what you said. You said, you will see greater enforcement of it?  MR. SPICER: I would refer you to the Department of Justice -- Q: But you said, you said there will be greater enforcement. MR. SPICER: No, no. I know. I know what I -- I think -- then that's what I said. But I think the Department of Justice is the lead on that. It is something that you should follow up with them, but I believe that they are going to continue to enforce the laws on the books with respect to recreational marijuana versus -- Q: Okay. And my real question if you don't mind. MR. SPICER: That first one was pretty real. Q: Ivanka Trump was in the White House today for a meeting on human trafficking. She had this meeting on CEOs. We saw her in a smaller session here at the White House today. What exactly is her role here? MR. SPICER: I think her role is to be helpful and provide input on a variety of areas that she has deep, passionate concerns about, especially in the area of women in the workforce and empowering women. She is someone who has a lot of expertise and wants to offer that, especially in the area of trying to help women. She understands that firsthand. And I think because of the success that she's had, her goal is to try to figure out -- and the understanding that she has a businesswoman -- to use her expertise and understanding to empower and help women have the same kind of opportunity and success that she's had. So --  Q: But still not a formal role? MR. SPICER: No, nothing more than you've seen now. I think, last night, the meeting that she had in Baltimore was one that was done on her own. There's areas that she's cared very passionately about before her time in the White House, or before her father coming to the White House, rather. And now that her father is in the White House, she continues to seek a platform that helps empower and lift up women, and give them opportunities and think of ways that they can be -- Q: Sean, thanks. On the human trafficking meeting today, the President said, well, when you talk about solving this kind of problem, that's a nice word, but it's really -- he suggested that, more likely, he could just help out on that problem. What's his definition of success in this? What's his goal? Is he looking at stronger criminal penalties? MR. SPICER: Well, Dave, I think that's, as I read out earlier, that the President understands that this is a serious problem both for adults, but particularly for children who are being sold both domestically and internationally, and it's why we brought these groups in. It's to make sure that we figure out how do we make that number as close to zero as possible and that we institute policies both domestically, but then abroad, and working with our partners to figure out how do we combat the trafficking of people.  So it's things that we can be forceful in terms of the rhetoric that the President uses, but also the enforcement tools that he uses both domestically and internationally. Trey. Q: Thanks, Sean. Has the President been briefed at all on the situation at Standing Rock? And is he concerned that a stand-off with protesters could slow down his executive orders on pipelines? MR. SPICER: Our team has been involved with both the tribe and the governor there, and so we are not only -- we are constantly in touch with them. And I think we feel very confident that we will move forward to get the pipeline moving. And so we'll have a further update on that, but I think we're in constant contact with the officials there.  Kristen. Q: Sean, thank you. Two topics I'd like to ask, but I wanted to start off by following on the transgender directive. Eight-two percent of transgender children report feeling unsafe at school. So isn't the President leaving some of these children open to vulnerable -- to being bullied at school? MR. SPICER: No. I mean, there are bullying laws and policies in place in almost every one of these schools. Q: Transgender children say their experience is --  MR. SPICER: But I don't think -- hold on -- Q: -- not being able to use the bathroom that they feel comfortable using because of vulnerability to bullying. MR. SPICER: But again, you're missing the point here, Kristen. The President said literally it should be a state decision. He respects the decision of the state. So therefore --  Q: So respecting kids is a states' rights issue? MR. SPICER: No, no, that's not -- you're trying to make an issue out of something that doesn't exist. It was the court who stopped this in August of last year. So where were the questions last year in August about this? It wasn't implemented correctly, legally, and the procedure wasn't followed because the court found, at the time, that it didn't have the authority to do that. So you're asking us why we're following the law that wasn't followed. And the reality is -- Q: Well, I'm asking you why you're reversing the Obama directive --  MR. SPICER: Hold on. No, no, we're not reversing it. Hold on. We're not reversing it. That is a misinterpretation of the scenario. The court stopped it. It enjoined it in August of last year because it wasn't properly drafted, and it didn't follow the procedures, and there was no legal basis for it in a law that was instituted in 1972.  So hold on -- for you to use those terms, frankly, doesn't reflect what the situation actually is and how it happened. That's just -- so to talk about us reversing something that was stopped by the courts. Q: I understand that -- MR. SPICER: No, no, but --  Q: -- but you're sending a message -- MR. SPICER: No, we're not. We're basically saying that it's a states' rights issue. If a state choses to do it, as I mentioned to April, when this circumstance came up at one of the President's own properties, he was very clear about his position on this. So for you to turn around and say what message is the President saying, where was the message when he sent it last year? I think the message shows that he's a guy with a heart that understands the trouble that many people go through. But he also believes that the proper legal recourse for this is with the states. He believes in the states' ability to determine what's right for their state versus another state.  Q: I understand what you're saying. But the LGBTQ: community yesterday said they felt --  MR. SPICER: I understand what --  Q: -- that what they perceiving is that those kids are not being respected.  MR. SPICER: But there's a difference what people may or may not feel and the legal process and the law. And the law right now doesn't allow for it under Title IX that was passed in 1972. And the procedure wasn't followed. The court saw this in August of last year for a reason. And all we're doing is saying that the proper place for this is in the states. And so for you to suggest what message is this sending, it's very simple: that it's a states' rights issue, and the states should enact laws that reflect the values, principles, and will of the people in their particular state. That's it, plain and simple. Q: Moving on to Obamacare very quickly, former House Speaker John Boehner predicted that a full repeal and replace of Obamacare -- his words -- ""is not going to happen."" He went on to say, ""Most of the framework of the Affordable Care Act, it's going to be there."" Do you think that he has a point? Are you going to -- MR. SPICER: Well, no, I think -- look, I think what we're going to end up with is something that I've talked about over and over again. We're going to end up with a more accessible plan that will allow people to see more doctors, have more providers, and drive costs down. Those are the two guiding principles that we're going to have in what the President is going to work with Congress to put forward on. That's it, plain and simple. Yes. Q: Sean, on roads and highways in the United States, in many places around the country potholes and other issues are affecting the way in which Americans travel. And the President has said he would fix these issues during the campaign. What is the status on that? And has the President spoken to heads of DOT or other people?  MR. SPICER: Well, I think the President is starting to address that through the budget process we talked about yesterday. It will be out in mid-March. And so the infrastructure projects and priorities that the President has talked about -- whether it's air control, and our airports, or the roads and bridges -- will be something that he's going to work with DOT, but also talk about in his budget. And you'll see more in his joint address to Congress.  With that, Laurel Staples of KECI-NBC in Montana. Q: Montana has hundreds of miles of border with Canada. And according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, almost 1 million people come across that border into Montana each year. What are the administration's plans to increase security on the Canadian border? And does the administration have any plans to build a wall there? (Laughter.)  MR. SPICER: Well, we're obviously concerned -- thank you -- at all sorts of immigration in this country, whether it's from our northern border or our southern border. I think the President understands that our southern border is where we have more of a concern in terms of the number of people and the type of activity that's coming over there in terms of the cartels and drug activity. But that doesn't mean that we're not paying attention to our northern border, as well. And we will continue to both monitor and take steps necessary at our northern border to ensure the safety of all Americans. Yes, sir. Q: One question on the South China Sea and a follow-up on the Dakota Access Pipeline. This week was the first week, I believe, that the Trump administration launched freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea. Can you give us a sense of how frequently you are going to be doing those? And then on the Dakota Access Pipeline, a few weeks ago President Trump said he would try to negotiate a solution between the Standing Rock Sioux and Energy Transfer Partners. Why hasn't the President intervened and tried to initiate those negotiations yet? MR. SPICER: So on the latter, our team has been in contact with all the parties involved. They have been working and communicating back and forth. So if we have an update on that -- but there has been work at the staff level between the parties. And then on the second -- on the first part, I've got no further update in terms of the frequency by which we will have stuff. Alexis. Q: Sean, in the Reuters interview with the President, he described again his interest in seeing the nuclear arsenal expand in the United States. Can you describe what it is that the President has in mind -- the timeframe and how he would like to pursue that? MR. SPICER: Yes, let's just be clear. He didn't -- what he was very clear on is that the United States will not yield its supremacy in this area to anybody. That's what he made very clear in there. And that if other countries have nuclear capabilities, it will always be the United States that has the supremacy and commitment to this. Obviously, that's not what we're seeking to do. The question that was asked was about other people growing their stockpiles. And I think what he has been clear on is that our goal is to make sure that we maintain America's dominance around the world, and that if other countries cloud it, we don't sit back and allow them to grow theirs. Francesca. Q: Sean, a domestic policy question and then a foreign policy question, if you will. You said yesterday that the President had named a task force on the voter fraud probe. When did he name that task force specifically?  MR. SPICER: I think two weeks ago he announced that Vice President Pence would lead that task force, and that the Vice President and his team were starting to look at members to do that. Q: So you were referring to the interview in which he said there would be a task force. MR. SPICER: That's right.  Q: Not that something has happened since then. MR. SPICER: That's correct.  Q: Okay. And then on foreign policy, the President had said in his Saturday campaign speech that the Gulf States would be paying for that safe zone in Syria. Which Gulf States was he referring to? Have any committed to paying for that? MR. SPICER: So if you look at the readouts that he's had with several of the foreign leaders that is brought up and mentioned in almost every one of them. And I think he's talked about the financing of the safe zones and the commitment that they need to make to those. And I think by and large, we've had widespread commitment. When we have an update on -- and I think that's an issue that's going to be ongoing at the Secretary of State level, as well, where you saw Secretary Tillerson follow up on that with numerous folks. We will have further updates on the funding of safe zones as we go forward. But there has been a general commitment by most of these heads of government to share in the President's commitment to help fund these things. Can I go to Steve Gruber of WJIM in Michigan? Q: Thank you, Sean. I greatly appreciate it. I'd like to talk to you more about tax policy, if I may. President Trump, of course, on the campaign trail talked a lot about tax policy and tax reform. That hasn't happened yet, as we know. But I want to talk about something different. That's the border adjustability tax. With the manufacturers that were at the White House again today, states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, others have a great concern about this tax, and there seems to be a disconnect between some of the CEOs, some of the Republicans on Capitol Hill and the President as to whether or not this is appropriate.  And I guess the question is: Could this tax have a chilling effect on manufacturing at a time when places like Ohio, and Michigan, and the Upper Midwest are trying to jumpstart the economy with manufacturing jobs? I wish for you to clarify, if you could, the President's position. MR. SPICER: Yes, Steve, thank you. I think the President has been very clear from the beginning that there is no tax if companies manufacture in the United States. We are one of only a handful of countries that doesn't tax the imports that come into our country. Almost every other country operates their tax code under that system. And so what happens is we have a system by which companies abroad can send their products -- tax our products going into their country and institute an import tax, and then their products come into the United States with no import tax -- which, frankly, gives a disincentive to companies to stay in the United States, to manufacture in the United States, to hire in the United States. And it tilts the field against the American worker. And so the President is looking at tax policy that encourages manufacturing and job creation in the United States. And if you think about it --  Q: So where is he on this border adjustability tax?  MR. SPICER: Hold on. Q: Where is he on this tax specifically?  MR. SPICER: I understand that. And I think that what he is doing is he met yesterday with his team on the budget. He's talked to Secretary Mnuchin and others who are working on a comprehensive tax reform plan. And remember, Steve, this isn't something that's been done since 1986. And so as we look at it, part of that is to make sure that we lower our corporate tax rate, that we make it more attractive to manufacture and grow jobs in the United States, to make our companies more competitive with companies overseas that, frankly, have better tax treatment than our own companies who stay in the United States. So creating more of a playing field that encourages manufacturing and growing and creating in the United States.  But make no mistake, if a company is in the United States already and expanding in the United States, it will be only to their benefit. Actually, if you think about it right now, the way the current tax code works, it almost incentivizes companies from leaving the United States, manufacturing, and expanding overseas, and then sending their goods and services back to the United States, which undermines our own economy, it undermines our workers. Q: But the question is about components coming back in the United States being manufactured. MR. SPICER: I understand, Steve. Okay, I know that you're on the Skype, but we only do like one or two follow-ups.  But the answer is, is that he's working towards comprehensive tax reform, and we'll have a plan out within the next few weeks that will address that. Yes. Q: On the transgender guidance, the administration not only rescinded it, but sent a letter to the Supreme Court informing them about the change as they consider a related case. Does the termination of the guidance present an administration position on the way the Supreme Court should rule? MR. SPICER: I'm sorry, on? Well, obviously, we're -- I'm sorry -- removing the guidance clearly does. The guidance that was put forward by the Obama administration, which clearly hadn't been done in a proper way in terms of how they solicited, or, rather, didn't solicit comments -- the guidance it puts forward obviously sends a signal to the Court on where the administration stands on this issue. Q: Can I ask you about Syria? Two quick questions. First, the talks have started again, peace talks in Geneva. The man convening them, Staffan de Mistura, says he's not detected a clear strategy on the political track from the administration. So what is the President's thinking on that? And in particular, what's his thinking on the future of President Assad, whether he can stay on in a transition or --  MR. SPICER: I will refer you to the State Department on the status of the talks. Q: But the overall strategy comes from here.  MR. SPICER: Right, I understand that. And that's one of the things that the President, whether it's safe zones or how we deal with Syria and the problems that -- Q: What's the President thinking on Assad's future? Just the key points. MR. SPICER: I understand that, thank you. Q: One other question then on Syria, if you don't mind. The fall of al-Bab in northern Syria, an important development on the battlefield, creates some space in that town that's fallen to the Turks and opposition. Is that the sort of space that the President would like to see a safe zone? MR. SPICER: I don't -- we're not trying to be prescriptive right now in terms of the geographic location of a safe zone. It's something that -- right now, the President's goal is to get commitments from other world leaders, both in terms of the funding and the commitment to share in how we do that. So I don't want to get -- we're not looking to be prescriptive today in how it's done. I think, overall, we need a greater commitment in the region to make sure that people are committed to a strategy and to safe zones to allow that to stop some of the human suffering that's going on and create -- while the rest of the conflict ensues. And I think that we've got to dual-track this -- deal with the conflict as a whole and how we address it, how we deal with ISIS in combatting it, but then we also have to -- there's a humanitarian piece to this as well with respect to the safe zones. And I think that we were looking at both pieces of this as well. Q: Thanks, Sean. Since the election, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has expressed some disquiet about pulling out of the Paris agreement on climate change. And the President has also heard from some world leaders about that. Can you tell us, is the President still committed to pulling out of the Paris agreement on climate change? MR. SPICER: I think I will leave that to Secretary Tillerson. That's a conversation that he's having with him as far as where we are on that. Q: Sean, thank you very much. I just have a follow-up to the Syria question first. Do you have any timeline when it comes to when he wants to see those safe zones actually being built? And I wanted to go back to the executive order on immigration. You've talked about these dual-tracks, where you're going to be doing the new executive order but also continuing to fight that in court. Can you give us a status update on where that legal fight is and what we should see happening? MR. SPICER: So with respect to the executive order, there are several courts that this is being fought in -- 10 or so -- and we continue to deal with that in all of those venues. And then again, I guess, the only way to say this is, then obviously on the dual-track side we have the additional executive order that we've talked about earlier that will come out and further address the problems. We continue to believe that the issues that we face specifically in the 9th district -- 9th Circuit, rather, that we will prevail on, on the merits of that. But on the other challenges that have come and the other venues and the others -- that we feel equally confident, as we did in Massachusetts and other venues. So it's not a single-track system.  And I'm sorry, I know you -- Q: Have you made a decision yet about the Supreme Court taking it there? And then the other question was on the safe zones and the timeline. MR. SPICER: So with respect to the Supreme Court, I mean, we've got to continue to work this through the process. So right now it's at the 9th Circuit. That's the primary problem that we are addressing. And then we don't have any timeline that I can announce today on Syrian safe zones. Q: I just want to follow up to this morning's meeting. And the President said that he gave authorization to a couple of countries to buy military equipment from the United States. Which countries was he referring to? And has he gone to Congress to ask for permission to do this? MR. SPICER: We'll follow up and get a list for you on that.  Jeff. Q: Sean, if I could ask again about the delay of the executive order until the next week. Is the administration still trying to craft its legal argument to this to withstand scrutiny, or why again the delay? I'm not sure I understand -- MR. SPICER: Yeah, and I think I asked and answered this earlier.  Q: Sorry, I don't understand the delay. MR. SPICER: Okay, then I'll explain it to you. I think the President this time -- we were very careful to understand what the court's concerns were and address them in the follow-up executive order. With respect to when we're going to announce it, part of this is to make sure that we work with the appropriate departments and agencies on the implementation of it to make sure that it is executed and it continues to be executed in a flawless manner, and that it meets the intent that it would serve. We understand the challenges that may come, and so we want to do this in a manner that makes sure that the Hill, other members of Congress, the appropriate agencies and departments are fully ready to implement this when it's issued. And so that's it. There's really nothing more to it. Q: There also is some concern -- if I can follow up -- there also is concern inside the Justice Department and in Homeland Security by some officials this afternoon that we're reporting that the White House is looking for them to help build this legal argument, to find a conclusion here. MR. SPICER: No, that's not -- basically, you're saying that we did our due diligence. We looked to the departments to ask them to review certain things. So last week it was we rushed stuff; this week, you're saying that we are taking our time and --  Q: Has it been more difficult than you thought it would be? MR. SPICER: No, that's not true. I don't think so. And I think you using continued unnamed sources -- I think it actually is a -- it will be implemented flawlessly because we've done the right thing and gone to these individuals, sought feedback and guidance, and done this in an unbelievably comprehensive way to ensure that departments and agencies that are going to be executing and implementing this fully are aware of what's happening. But this has been done in a very, very comprehensive way.  Yeah, sorry. Q: Thank you, Sean. Melanie Arter, CNSNews.com. Former Labor Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder admitted that for a few years he unwittingly employed an illegal immigrant as a housekeeper. Is this administration committed to holding employers accountable when they employ illegal aliens? And how does the administration plan to do so? MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think that was -- that issue was something that Mr. Puzder was very forthcoming on. And when he recognized the situation that had occurred, he paid all the appropriate taxes and tried to help the individual go through the proper process. And so, yeah, we're going to continue to make sure that we hold individuals in compliance with the law. And he did the right thing then, but whether it's companies or individuals, I think, we are committed to making sure that people do what's right.  Yes, ma'am. Q: Veronica Clearly, with Fox 5. I have two questions. Janet Evancho -- she sang the National Anthem -- she requested a meeting with the President. Her sister is transgender. Is he going to take that meeting, or meet with anyone from the transgender community during this conversation? MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think the President would be welcome to meet with her. Q: The second question -- second question. Steve Bannon today called the media the opposition party. Last week, there was lots of conversation about the fake news and us being the enemy of the people. Some have said that this is really just a branding of the media, where he did that in the primaries, branding ""Little Marco"" and ""Lyin' Ted"". Is this -- MR. SPICER: Well, no, that was the President. Just to -- Q: Right, of course. But is this a branding strategy to --  MR. SPICER: No, I think that's what Steve believes. Q: But this is real. MR. SPICER: Absolutely, of course, it's real. I don't think he'd go out -- Steve has been very clear about his position on the media and how he believes it distorts things. So I don't think there's -- Q: From the whole administration? MR. SPICER: No, no. Hold on. I just said that that is what Steve's view is. He's made it several times, and I think he's very clear on that. Sarah. Q: Thanks, Sean. Back to the border adjustment tax. President Trump has told Reuters that he does support some form of a border tax. How does the President respond to critics that are saying the border adjustment tax will be passed on to lower-income and middle-class families in the form of higher prices for goods and higher prices for gas? MR. SPICER: Well, I think if you look at holistically -- I mean, the first thing to understand is that there is no tax if you're manufacturing in the United States, so there can be no higher cost. But if you think about it right now, we have to look at this in a holistic way, which is, when a company chooses to leave our country and shed American jobs so they can move overseas, and then sell back to us at a lower price, there's a big cost that comes to our economy and to our workers. And so we've got to look at this comprehensively.  But if a company chooses to stay and grow in the United States, hire more people, it actually will be a net savings, if you think about it, because it will be the companies who are overseas, who have chosen to move out of the country who will face a higher cost under these kind of plans.  And that's a big difference. It will actually benefit consumers, benefit workers, and benefit out economy. And that's -- when you really think about the economic impact about that, that benefits our economy, it helps our American workers, it grows more jobs, it grows the manufacturing base. And again, we are probably one of only a handful of developed countries that don't have a tax system that looks at this. And so right now, it's America and American workers and American manufacturing that are the disadvantage of the current regulatory and tax system, not the other way around. Thank you, guys. Have a great day. We'll touch base tomorrow in some way. I will see you then. Tune in to CPAC to see the President. END  3:52 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-02-24,"1:38 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Hey, guys. You saw the President signed an executive order today, another important step towards eliminating job-crushing regulations and keeping the government agencies accountable by getting America back to work, just as he promised to do. This afternoon, he's meeting with Governor Kasich. The President of Peru, as I mentioned yesterday, will be swinging by. Over the weekend, the President is going to be continuing to work on his joint address. He's hosting a dinner in the State Dining Room of our nation's governors. And the First Lady has a bunch of activities planned. There's a ball Sunday night that the First Lady is hosting for the governors and their spouses.  And as I mentioned yesterday -- and I think that's kind of it. So with that, let me -- Q: What is he going to talk to Kasich about? MR. SPICER: This is something that they wanted to get together after the election and catch up, and discuss sort of the issues and agenda that the President is implementing, and hopefully how some of these things -- I think coal will probably come up. But we'll try and see if we can get a readout of that afterwards. We generally don't provide readouts of that, but let me see what I can do. Q: Will the RNC come up? MR. SPICER: Will the RNC? What about the RNC? Q: About the convention that he didn't attend. MR. SPICER: Oh, I don't know. I doubt it. My guess is that we're talking about things going forward. It's obviously not for me to decide what the President discusses or what Governor Kasich decides to talk about. Q: Hey, Sean, just housekeeping-wise, can you just say why you decided to do this today off camera? And then can you talk about some of the information that has come out from senior administration officials this morning regarding some of the pushback on The New York Times reporting that was on background? MR. SPICER: I literally have said since day one that we would have some sort of gathering every day. The President spoke today. As you know, we don't generally do -- we haven't done briefings when the President has had a major event or an event with a world leader. And we put it on the schedule yesterday that we were just going to gaggle. I don't -- I mean, this is something that we've talked about with the Correspondents' Association about making sure that we had daily contact with you guys.  And I think -- obviously the President gave a very powerful speech today, and our job is to make sure that we're responsive to folks in the media. We're here all day. We've got a big staff. And we want to make sure we answer your questions. We don't need to do everything on camera every day. I think the President did a good job of making sure that -- today at CPAC, on camera, for a long time. And I wanted to make sure that the President's message carried.  Oh, and then with respect to -- Q: Can you talk about -- exactly, the pushback from this morning? MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think -- we gathered with a small group this morning. And I think part of this is to make sure that, especially in the case of CNN in particular, it was -- you were -- I think several media outlets, who, a majority, frankly, carried it very responsibly in terms of how the events unfolded. But it's a pretty serious accusation. And when you see the chyrons on CNN and the headlines and their story making it appear as though we did something wrong or nefarious, we wanted to make sure that we set the record straight.  And I think that this morning was an opportunity to push back on what actually happened and why it happened. And I think with respect to the events, just to be clear -- and I know we've gone over some of it -- that the deputy director of the FBI was at the White House for a 7:30 meeting, or whenever it was, the morning that the story came out. He asked to see the chief of staff after the meeting privately, and said, in very colorful terms, that The New York Times story was not accurate. As would anyone, frankly, at the time say, ""Could you clarify that then? If it's not true, could you clarify the story?"" The deputy director said, ""I'll get back to you."" When he got back to us, he said, hey, look, we don't want to get in the practice of starting to refute every story. The chief of staff said, well, you've put us in a very difficult situation; you've told us that a story that made some fairly significant accusations was not true. And now you want us to just go out there -- and I think that we have a right, if there's information, or if you're saying the story is not right, could you at least make it available to the media or some folks in the media that, yes, that story is not right? It made very, very serious allegations.  And further in the day, the director of the FBI said to Reince that you have every right to go out there and say that you've been briefed by us, which he did. Q: So a clarification on that. And on ""Meet the Press,"" when the chief of staff obviously said that he had had permission from senior intelligence officials, he was speaking about McCabe, the deputy director? MR. SPICER: And the director. Q: So they had given him explicit permission? MR. SPICER: They said, literally the story in The New York Times is not accurate. Q: Sean, do you have any idea what -- Q: Sorry, I just want to follow up on this thread. The President said today that he doesn't like the idea of unnamed sources. Obviously, this administration briefs on background, meaning on the condition that you not be named. Is that going to change now? MR. SPICER: No, no, but I'll give you a great example. This morning -- there's a big difference -- Q: But -- MR. SPICER: Hold on, Hallie, let me answer the question. Q: I didn't get to the question. MR. SPICER: Okay, go ahead. Q: Is there -- go ahead, you first. MR. SPICER: No, I didn't let you get to your question, so go ahead. Seriously, keep going. Q: The question was, do you plan to change that? Are you going to do all your briefings on the record? MR. SPICER: So there is, I think, a big difference -- this morning was an example where we wanted to have a free-flowing exchange with reporters. At the end of the conversation, several reporters said, can we use some of this on the record? We said yes. So the answer is, is that there is times when -- Q: But it's -- MR. SPICER: Hold on, Hallie. Let me just answer. Q: All right, I'm just flowing. MR. SPICER: I think there is an opportunity -- there's a way to use background sourcing to be able to have a much more robust discussion about some things. We came back, as the example this morning, and said, sure, there are quotes that you can use on the record. I think there's a big difference between explaining a policy and wanting to be able to have that kind of discussion where you say, hey, let's do this on background. And I think, generally speaking, we've been pretty open to saying, sure, we'll put those statements on -- or if you want to clear some stuff on the record, for the most part we've been very good about it. There's a big difference between making serious allegations -- us coming back on the record, and reporters saying, well, we have five sources that are unnamed that say contrary to that. I think there's a point at which there's an obligation, if you're going to make a very serious allegation, and we're willing to push back on the record that there be somebody at the very least that's willing to push back on this and say that they'll put their name attached to it. When you look at the reporting that The New York Times initially did, it was all background sources. It basically accused the President and his campaign team of doing some very, very serious stuff. We pushed back against that reporting at the time, and we were met with, ""Well, we have unnamed sources."" And I think there's an obligation at some when, if you're going to make allegations of a serious nature, to at least make somebody go on the record and say, yes, I'm willing to stand behind that, when we're willing to or another organization is willing to refute them on the record. So we often get met with us going on the record in multiple ways with reporters to only be told, ""Well, we're not going to believe you on the record because we've got one, two, three unnamed sources that we're not going to tell you who they are, where they're from, whether or not they're even in the circle of orbit."" And in many cases, when I push against reporters, I'll say, look, there were four people in that meeting -- here are the four people. Can you confirm any of them? ""Well, no they were people who heard from them."" So I've literally gone back to people and said, there is a room that occurred with four, five, six people in it, and this didn't happen because I was in the room. And they'll say, yeah, but people who were briefed by those people. So how many degrees of telephone do you play before at least you're willing to say, if someone in the room won't at least put their name on it or you won't admit that somebody in the room is willing to say it? I think that that undermines the credibility of some of the reporting that's going on. Q: Can you explain the distinction that the administration has drawn between a lot of conservative anger about the Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton conversation versus the obviously Reince Priebus-Deputy Director conversation? The administration has said it's different because the Chief of Staff was talking about a report, a news report and not an investigation. But the report was about an investigation. So does the administration worry that the Chief of Staff has crossed the line? MR. SPICER: No, no, no, hold on, hold on. And I brought this up this morning -- sorry for those of you who have to listen to this twice -- let's reverse-engineer this in two ways. Number one, the deputy director comes to us. We didn't go to them. The differences in the case --  Q: I'm not going to rehash, but I want to get this --  MR. SPICER: No, no, I am. But I --  Q: I think it's important to get on the record. MR. SPICER: And I will. And, by the way, just as a side note, as I mentioned to one of your colleagues today, doing a gaggle doesn't preclude us from doing something on camera later today. And I'm more than welcome -- I think the idea was that with time being what it is today, we wanted to just make sure that you guys got up-to-dated on a variety of issues. But there's nothing that precludes us from saying, hey, we'll go do an on-camera interview. So just the idea that we don't do something in the Briefing Room doesn't preclude. Here's the thing -- there's a big difference. The deputy director came to the chief of staff of the White House and literally said, the story is false.  So here are the two scenarios. One is, the chief of staff says nothing and just stares at him, which is what some of the folks in this room believe he should have done, he should have just sat there and said -- (indicating) -- which, now if any of you -- the second piece of this is that nine times out of ten0, when I deal with you guys, and I'll say we had a big problem with the story in X publication or X outlet, the first question I get asked is: Well, did you push back? Did you ask for a correction?  And I think in this case, the point is, is that all we simply did was say, wow, you're bringing us information saying that something -- a story in The New York Times is not accurate. So is there something that you're doing to let other journalists know that it's not true? Because they're asking us. So that morning I got, let's say, five, ten, fifteen phone calls from you and your colleagues, saying, ""Hey, there's a report in The New York Times -- what do you think about it?"" Well, if someone is coming to us telling us that it's not a true story, our goal was to literally just say to them, will your public affairs office take this phone call?  Q: Sean, is there an expectation --  MR. SPICER: I just want to be clear. I really am intrigued by I don't know what else we were supposed to do. We were provided information. And this notion that I see on CNN about we pushed back or we applied pressure. Pressure, by definition, is applying force. So if we had said, ""If you don't do this, if you don't do that,"" that's pressure. And I get that. That would have been wrong. ""We order you to do this. We require you to do that. We're urging"" -- we literally responded when presented with information and said, ""Could you let the media know that, what you're informing us of?""  And the answer was, well, we don't want to get in the middle of starting a practice of doing this. So our answer is, well, why did you come to us with this information if not to elicit a response?  I don't know what else you do except for say, gosh, could you clear the record up? That is a very different scenario than trying to exert influence on a situation. We literally responded to what they came to us with and said, okay, what are you going to do about it? And again, if you take --  Q: Did you -- MR. SPICER: Hold on, I'll finish with this, because the thing that's interesting to me is that had we not done anything and just sat there, what would -- it would have been irresponsible and, frankly, malpractice to say, yes, I was informed that we didn't do anything, and yet I didn't act.  Q: So we talked about this six hours ago, all that same stuff. Can we just move ahead a little bit here? Do you have any idea what McCabe's motivation was in coming forward? MR. SPICER: No. Q: Because then he asked the Chief of Staff to call him back at the FBI, only to then be told from the FBI Headquarters, there's nothing we can do. And then it was a very small circle of people who knew about this, and yet it leaked. MR. SPICER: I think that's concerning. Again, remember the timetable. We didn't ask them for that meeting. Reince had never met the guy prior to that morning. He wouldn't have known who he was. And frankly -- so he showed up at a meeting. Director Comey was traveling that day. It was an intel meeting on a separate subject. So the idea that -- and again, they don't dispute -- from what I understand -- any of this chronology that he pulled him aside. So if you logically can ask yourself why would he have pulled him aside to update him on a story just to say, ""Hey, I know we've never met before, but I just wanted to know if you read the paper today""? Logically that makes zero sense.  So I don't know what his motivations were. I don't -- I think hopefully to make sure that they knew that they were informing up what the status of the story was.  And can I make one more claim? Because this just dovetails into something that Hallie asked. Just so we're clear -- because I've seen a lot of reporting about was it proper or whatever -- first of all, there's nothing -- there is literally a memo out from past Attorneys General about how the DOJ will deal with the White House. There is literally a carve-out for dealing with public affairs. This is a story in The New York Times that was not accurate, according to them. So this idea about how we handled it, or how they handled it, there is literally in the memo -- which is all it is, it's a guidance memo -- there's literally a carve-out that specifically addresses how to handle public affairs. Q: Let me just come back to the leak. Because you've got three people who were in this loop. MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: You've got the chief of staff of the White House. You've got the deputy director and the director of the FBI.  MR. SPICER: Right.  Q: And yet this somehow leaks.  MR. SPICER: I think that's why the President -- Q: If the President is pursuing leaks, it would seem that he doesn't have to look too far. MR. SPICER: And that's why I think you've seen the President's tweet on this today, and you've heard the President's comments. He is not just today, but last week at the press conference. This is troubling when an FBI or anyone in the intelligence world, or, frankly, anyone in government entrusted with classified information and national security information is sharing that information widely. Yeah, that's a big problem. And I think you've seen the President's concern for this issue. Q: Should he fire somebody? Is he going to fire Director Comey? MR. SPICER: I'm not going to -- I think I will leave it at the President's tweet speaks for itself, and the President's comments on his concern for national security -- yes, it's concerning. Overall -- overall, it's concerning. Charlie. Q: Pulling back, this Russia narrative continues to dog the administration and it's something that Americans have been paying attention to, it's something the media has been paying attention to. How do you -- what's your goal to sort of end this narrative? Is there any way you could answer more questions, do more things to finish this thing that started right after the election, that somehow the President has an improper relationship with Russia? Is he prepared to answer some of these questions, release some more details to finally put an end to this? Or are we just going to continue to find out about his connections through these leaks? MR. SPICER: Well, again, there are no connections to find out about. That's the problem. I think, A, he's answered it forcefully. You can't disprove something that doesn't exist. He's talked about the fact how many times he's talked to Putin. He has no interests in Russia. He has no -- there's only so many times he can deny something that doesn't exist.  Q: Until another leak comes out? MR. SPICER: But what are the leaks? The leaks don't actually -- again, you've got a story that comes out from The New York Times with unnamed sources. You have the FBI coming to us. And frankly -- and I don't -- I know that I do a really good job of lecturing you guys, so I'll try to stay silent on a Friday. But to some degree the true story -- and Chairman Nunes from the House Intelligence Committee is on the record saying that he received a report and corroborates it. At some point, isn't the story that actually the accusations that came out have been disputed? Q: I guess the question is -- MR. SPICER: Hold on. The House Intelligence Committee came out, after getting the briefing, and said that the story is demonstrably false. And I don't mean to put words into the chairman's mouth there. I think he's quoted in the Wall Street Journal. But, at some point, isn't the story actually that there is no story, to your point; that it's been disproven, and it's not the level to which The New York Times has made it to be?  But all we have done from the get-go is exactly what you're asking, which is to continue to disprove a negative. Q: Sean, on that -- but continuing with that though, are you then saying that you would encourage, not interfere with, and not in any way encourage the Attorney General to suppress the investigation? Because there is some suggestion of that. Putting this story aside, there is a suggestion that there is suppression. MR. SPICER: I know, but the only suggestion, Margaret, with all due respect, is from you guys. There was -- we were not aware of -- Q: Actually, it's not. There -- MR. SPICER: No, no, no -- but who? So you have someone like Nancy Pelosi coming out and making a wildly inappropriate statement.  Q: I'm speaking specifically to the Department of Justice, not Capitol Hill.  MR. SPICER: I understand that. But in other words, we're not aware of an investigation, so how would we be able to -- well, I'm sorry, what was the word that you used? Q: Suppression. MR. SPICER: But, but -- so if you're going to make an accusation like that, where is the evidence that there has been anything that A, exists, or B, that we've suppressed anything? Q: But the question was, are you actually saying any investigation -- if there was any reason to investigate, the Department of Justice should go ahead, because there is a --  MR. SPICER: Sure. Q: -- suggestion at the Department of Justice, on the -- MR. SPICER: Sure, if there is evidence of anything --  Q: -- that there is -- MR. SPICER: No, that's their job. Look -- Q: -- (inaudible) question. MR. SPICER: Right. And I think we've made it clear that if there's evidence of something, pursue it. And we've said that very clearly about the House and Senate. There is nothing to -- we have nothing to hide. The President has been crystal-clear consistently over and over again. And my point to you is that at some point you use words like ""suppression"" or ""investigation"" -- then show us. Where's this investigation? Where is the suppression that's occurring? Where's the so-called pushback or pressure?  I mean, respectfully, guys, I don't -- I find a lot of this offensive. When you talk about us pushing back on something that doesn't exist, at some point answer the opposite -- which is, what were we supposed to do when presented by information by them? Sit back and do nothing?  Q: I'm not speaking about that point and case. I'm talking about at the Department of Justice, writ large, investigating ties to Russia. Is that an investigation that should continue to proceed? MR. SPICER: If they have an investigation, then they should do what they want. They should follow the law.  Q: And is that the message that the President has delivered to the Attorney General?  MR. SPICER: I mean, he literally swore him in. I think something like, I hope you execute the -- I mean, why would he have to -- again, respectfully, it's insulting that the President would have to tell the Attorney General to follow the law. Did you ask the same question about Obama with respect to Holder? I mean, with all of the stuff that went out there, did you -- Q: There are reports and those are lines of questions that -- MR. SPICER: Did you ever ask that question? Q: I wasn't covering that case, but there were reporters at my network who did. MR. SPICER: They did? So they did. You can -- Q: I believe it was CBS that broke the ""Fast and Furious"" story. But anyway, moving -- MR. SPICER: That's not what I asked. No, no, I didn't ask that question. I'm saying, did you ever question the White House, or did CBS, on the record, question the Obama administration whether or not they asked the Attorney General to follow the law? Q: But there is -- Sean -- MR. SPICER: No, see what you just did? You told --- Q: I'm trying to answer you. There is a sort of boilerplate speaking point, talking point to say we don't want to impede an ongoing investigation, we hope that all those thing -- MR. SPICER: Did you ever ask the Obama administration the same question? Q: About this? No. MR. SPICER: No, about whether or not they asked Attorney General Holder to follow the law. These boilerplate language -- Q: There were plenty of questions about interference -- MR. SPICER: No, no, look -- Q: Yes, there were plenty of questions about interference. MR. SPICER: So you can you tell me that CBS asked the White House that same question? Q: About whether the Justice Department was interfering in investigations? MR. SPICER: Would follow the law, would use this ""boilerplate language""? Q: Yes. MR. SPICER: Okay. Q: But to the point, there are people that -- MR. SPICER: No, no, no, but you don't get to pivot, Margaret. Q: I'm not. I'm actually asking to stay on the topic, which was the topic of the Russia investigation, not what you're talking about. So on the topic of the Russia investigation, what you have said is there is no knowledge at the White House of any investigation into ties with Russia? MR. SPICER: I am not aware of an investigation. If there was one, then they should follow the law. But I don't think -- I will definitely try to look for whether or not CBS asked the same question to the White House during the eight years of the Obama administration. Because at least I never saw that. Q: Sean, can you say why Mr. Priebus wanted -- when he talked to McCabe -- why did he then want the FBI to go do, on their own, bat this story down? Was there something about it being more credible if the FBI were to speak up about than if it was just coming from -- MR. SPICER: Okay, so just stop for a second. Let's walk through this logically. I come to you and say, hey, there's evidence that whatever you've been accused of is not true. What's your response? No, no, answer the question. Q: You said to me that there's evidence of -- MR. SPICER: So you've been accused of some wrongdoing, and I come to you and say, hey, guess what -- the accusations that you've been accused of I know they aren't true. Q: I'd love for you to tell everybody. I'm asking specifically in this case. I'm just asking in this case was there a sense, on this subject matter, which is politically very loaded, where you feel you haven't been treated well, that it would be more useful for the administration if the FBI spoke up -- MR. SPICER: No, it's not a question of useful. They came to us and said, this story is not true. We said, great, could you tell people that? Reporters are asking us, we've denied it. We did deny it. I'm really having a tough time understanding the logic of your question. They story gets printed in The New York Times. Just to be clear, let's think about this for a second. If we knew that this story was false and we wanted the FBI to pressure, wouldn't we have asked the day before when the story was coming out? Q: I wasn't suggesting you asked them to pressure. That was not the premise of the question. MR. SPICER: So they come to us with information that morning and say, the story that was published is not accurate. What should have been the White House's response? Q: I'm not going to say what your response should have been. But do you see what I'm asking is -- MR. SPICER: No, I don't. I really don't. I think it's insane. I think it really -- the idea that you're saying someone tells you that something is false -- Q: Did you think that denial would be more credible if it came from the FBI instead of from you? MR. SPICER: Of course, it would. Because the story listed intelligence sources as saying -- The New York Times said, according to multiple sources in the intelligence community, this is false. If the FBI and part of the intelligence community says, we believe it's false, it came out after we had denied it -- and, of course, The New York Times didn't believe us, said, oh, we have X number of sources in the intel community, you're wrong -- why wouldn't we want someone with credibility who's saying, we have no evidence that this story is accurate, come out and say that? Q: I guess what I'm aiming towards is, are you trying to -- do you guys feel like there's been background sources from the intelligence community saying things that you dispute, that you don't like? Is this part of a broader effort to get the intelligence community -- MR. SPICER: That's barely -- you show a lack of -- I mean -- Q: To go on the record. MR. SPICER: No, no, hold on, hold on. Just stop for a second. They come to us and say, ""The New York Times is quoting intelligence sources claiming X, Y and Z. We don't believe that that's accurate."" ""Okay, could you please let people know that that's not true?"" Q: And I'm saying, when you say that, is that a way of asking them to get their house in order if these sources are talking -- MR. SPICER: No, it's a way of saying -- if someone witnesses something that happened and says, I'm willing to go out and say that, hey, I saw that actually the car went right and not left, and I can clear this up -- wouldn't you want the witness to do that? The FBI is saying, we are in the intelligence business, we didn't think that story was accurate; we wanted you to know. Our answer is, great, reporters are calling us -- could you let them know? Q: But I think that happens pretty regularly, that the FBI tells you something and they are not deciding what's going to go into the public sphere or not. That's your job, right? MR. SPICER: Not if -- we had to -- I mean, no, actually it doesn't, to be honest with you. It's the first time that I've seen it happen. Obviously, we had never had -- the chairman had never -- the chief of staff had never met this guy before. So for him to come over and say, hey, by the way -- no, that doesn't -- at least in my 30-some-odd days, it's never happened. Q: I guess what I was wondering is why it's so unusual for them to want the White House, the political component, to be the ones deciding about what gets put -- MR. SPICER: I don't know, ask them. Again, I hate to probably break some norm, but maybe you should direct your question to them. I know that's probably -- now you're going to have stories about how I directed reporters to call the public affairs office to do --  Q: But I'm asking you the question.  MR. SPICER: No, no, because -- I know, and I've asked and answered it, like, 18 times.  Q: Sean, did Reince talk to counsel, the White House Counsel's Office after he talked to McCabe? MR. SPICER: I don't -- it's possible. It's very possible that they were in the initial meeting. I'm sure that he has followed up with counsel and said, hey, I just was told this -- at some point. Q: This is a bit of a difficult situation and what do we do.  MR. SPICER: But again, at the beginning part, the answer was to tell -- to say to McCabe, hey, let us know how you want to handle this. Q: So that secondary -- MR. SPICER: Just remember the response, which is, it wasn't a directive. We didn't say, ""Go do the following."" That's a directive. That could be -- we literally said, ""What can you do to help get the world out? Could you take calls from reporters? Will you clear this up?""  Q: But that kind of, ""what could you do"" wasn't -- to your knowledge it wasn't after he had spoken to counsel and said -- MR. SPICER: Oh, no, it was immediate. Q: Okay.  MR. SPICER: Like, ""Hey, what can you do?"" And the answer that McCabe gave was, ""Give me a few hours to get back to you and see what we can do."" Q: So you know what McCabe went away and did in those two hours? I mean, was he talking to his own counsel? MR. SPICER: I don't know. You should ask him. I don't want to -- Q: Okay.  Q: Sean, going forward, then, with the FBI, you have a fundamental persistent dispute with them about them stepping into such matters and -- MR. SPICER: I don't -- in terms of what, Dave? Q: In terms of if this situation arises again where they have information that they could back down an untrue story -- MR. SPICER: I think that the FBI -- sure. I mean, if the FBI knows something to be false, unless it hinders intelligence-gathering, an ongoing investigation, I don't want to get in the -- I mean, our job isn't to get in the way of them doing their job, i.e. investigating something or uncovering a plot, or whatever they're doing. If there's some reason that they have to act in accordance to protect this country, they should by all means do it. But to come to somebody and say, you've been accused of some pretty serious things and we know them not to be accurate, I would assume that you would want -- I mean, isn't their job justice?  I mean, that's -- I mean, if you wrote a story that was knowingly false and somebody came to you and said, I know, Dave, that the story you wrote is false and I've got some facts to prove it, I would hope and I do believe that you would say, get them to me and I'm going to update the story.  If this was you, and you had written a story and someone from the FBI came to you and said, hey, I know you wrote that story, Dave, or, Hallie, I saw your package last night, and, gosh, we're in the intel community and I'm willing to let you know it's not accurate -- I would assume that your answer would be, okay, what do I need to do to correct it, or what can I do, or what can you give me.  Q: So the administration still maintains there is no investigation. MR. SPICER: No, that's not what I said, Charlie. No. I literally said then when presented with a story that we were told was not accurate, our answer was, could you go tell other people that it's not accurate or correct it, or whatever you see fit. But what are we doing to get the story or the facts straight? Q: So you don't know whether or not there is an investigation. MR. SPICER: I know nothing more than they told us a story was not accurate. And our answer was, what are you going to do to get the story right. It wasn't -- that's it, full stop. There was no discussion about anything beyond the story. And the story wasn't right. And I believe he used -- Q: So you're not aware of any investigation into Russia, did I misunderstand that? MR. SPICER: I'm not aware of one. Huh? You asked me if I was aware. I am not.  Q: Is the administration? MR. SPICER: I don't -- that's a pretty broad term. I'm not aware of one. And so --  Q: More broadly then, to this point, is there concern -- or what does this say about the relationship between the administration and the FBI, given that you used words like ""concerned,"" ""troubling,"" talking about leaks? Should Americans be concerned about fallout between the White House and the FBI? MR. SPICER: I think you should -- no, I mean, all I know is they've told us some information, we've asked them to help get the word out. That's where it stands. Q: But you called the potential leaks ""troubling"" and ""concerning.""  MR. SPICER: No, I was asked about the leaks, Hallie. Q: But you directed us back to the President's tweet, which says, ""The FBI is totally unable to stop the national security 'leakers'."" Are we to deduce that the President has lost confidence in the FBI and the Director? MR. SPICER: I think that I'm going to let the President's tweet stand for itself. But I think that -- and again, I think he commented on this last week, that there is a concern -- these are two separate issues. One is the instance at hand and the story that came out, and the second is the leaks that are coming out. Q: And on a sort of semi-related note, this banner on CNN right now that says ""CNN and others have been blocked from media briefings,"" are CNN and The New York Times not in here right now because you're unhappy with their reporting? And why are they not in here? MR. SPICER: Because we had a pool and then we expanded it, and we added some folks to come and cover it. Q: But there's enough room for others in here. MR. SPICER: It was my decision to decide -- you know, to expand the pool. Yeah. Q: Sean, the President said today at CPAC, ""We're going to do something about it"" in reference to these stories that he is saying are false by The New York Times and CNN and others. What is he talking about there? MR. SPICER: I'm sorry, say the beginning. Q: He said, ""We are going to do something about it"" when he was referencing -- MR. SPICER: Well, I mean, I think we're going to aggressively push back. We're just not going to sit back and let false narratives, false stories, inaccurate facts get out there.  Q: In terms of leaks, what's the next step? The President has been concerned -- MR. SPICER: The President is not going to tell you how he's going to handle this. Obviously, that would undermine the ability to block them if people knew what he was going to do or how he was going to handle it. Q: Can I first ask about the shooting in Kansas of the two Indian Americans and what the President's response to it was, but also if there's any concern that some of the rhetoric that the President or -- that generally has been out here recently could have contributed in any way to that or stepped up violence? MR. SPICER: I mean, obviously, any loss of life is tragic, but I'm not going to get into, like, that kind of -- to suggest that there's any correlation I think is a bit absurd. So I'm not going to go any further than that. Q: Can I ask about the CEA? Politico is saying that Kevin Hassett is the President's choice. I'm wondering if you can confirm that. MR. SPICER: I can't.  Q: And then more broadly, the CEA is not among the President's Cabinet positions anymore and I'm wondering if you can explain -- MR. SPICER: I don't think it was during Bush, was it? Q: I know it was under Obama. MR. SPICER: Okay, so what's -- okay. Some positions are and some positions aren't. I mean, there are -- Q: Well, can you just explain the logic behind -- MR. SPICER: No, I can't. I mean, I think the President makes a decision -- he can always expand his Cabinet. But I think that there's some Cabinet positions that each administration decides are part of their Cabinet, some aren't. And I think the President has an unbelievably talented group of economic advisors, from Steve Mnuchin to Wilbur Ross to Robert Lighthizer, should he be confirmed by the Senate, as well as Wilbur and others. So it's every President's prerogative to decide beyond the statutory members of the Cabinet who else to have included. Q: Can I follow up on the shooting? You mentioned that -- is it the -- what part is the ""absurd""? I guess I'm just -- MR. SPICER: Well, it's absurd to suggest that rhetoric. And I think the point that was at least -- I think the -- Q: I mean, the comment from the man supposedly is, ""Get out of my country."" Is it a question of it's too early to call it a hate crime? MR. SPICER: No, no, no, but I think they're pointing out -- at least what I thought was being asked is, is there any, like -- was it your intention to suggest that there was, like, a connection between --  Q: I mean, I think that -- I didn't want to say, this person did -- I mean, I don't think any of us could know that possibly. MR. SPICER: Well, I think to sort of -- to right now intimate what the motives are is too early. I mean, I guess my point is to sort of jump to a conclusion. We've seen that too often in the past -- in Florida and other places where people jump to a conclusion. This is -- we're not going to be subject to calling a video as the Clinton -- as the Obama administration did. I mean, let's let law enforcement do its job before we start jumping to conclusions. Q: Do you know of any other parts of the administration looking into this potentially? The Department of Justice, for example, maybe? MR. SPICER: I don't have anything for you on this.  Q: So today, President Trump talked about how he's going to build up the military, there's going to be a big funding request. Can you talk about how much money does the President think he's going to need to ask for? And how is this going to be paid for? MR. SPICER: Well, I think there's two things. One, I think he'll touch on this in the joint address. But, secondly, the budget that's come out will be very clear about where a lot of that funding will come from. And so I don't want to get ahead of either of those, but I will -- I think they're good questions that will be answered in due time, both beginning with the joint address -- we'll touch on that. And, second, from a more detailed standpoint, the budget, specifically with respect to the savings and how savings and how additional funding would be processed. Q: And regarding the joint address, do you imagine the joint address will be kind of like this very broad, like overhead look at what the President plans to do? Or will it be very specific, like bullet points, this is what we're going to do, very specific policies that we're going to enact? MR. SPICER: I think it will be a little bit of a blend. More so the former than the latter. I think he's going to talk very optimistically about where we're going to go as a country and the general policies that he's going to pursue to get us there. I don't think this is going to be the same old Christmas tree kind of State of the Union. And I think there is a little bit of a traditional tweak between a joint address and a State of the Union.  Q: Is the President going to meet with insurers on Monday? MR. SPICER: I'll have Lindsay get out -- we're going to get the schedule together. I think --  Q: Sean --  MR. SPICER: Hold on, I told Gabi, and then I've got to be downstairs. Q: Okay, I have a question on the budget. With so few Cabinet Secretaries confirmed right now, is the White House working with agencies to ensure that their submissions are being --  MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: Okay, and do you expect the budget to be thin because of the absence of Cabinet Secretaries? MR. SPICER: No. Q: Okay. MR. SPICER: I think -- I mean, it may be thin, but that's because of -- I'm joking. I think the President's commitment to getting Washington in order is going to be very apparent in the budget, and his desire to respect taxpayers and duplicity in government and programs that are outdated is going to be very much reflected in the budget. But we start that process sometime next week, where they start the passback process of going through departments and what their top lines are and things like that. Q: If I could just ask one more question on immigration. Before the President was inaugurated, he said that approximately 2 million to 3 million criminal illegal aliens would be deported during his first year in office. But according to the guidance that Secretary Kelly sent out earlier this week, they are now saying that law enforcement officials should be also looking at apprehending and deporting low-level criminal illegal immigrants and anybody that DHS deems a public risk. How does the administration -- I mean, number one, can we expect that figure -- 2 million to 3 million -- to expand now that it seems the definition of criminal illegal aliens has expanded? And also, how are you going to ensure that somebody who didn't just get a traffic ticket isn't included in that -- under that definition? MR. SPICER: I'm not -- we're not going to ensure anything. I mean, that's the job of ICE -- or DHS and then, more specifically, ICE, is to look at who is in this country, where they sit on that. But it is not the job of the White House to get involved and do carve-outs about misdemeanor versus that. People who I think -- I would actually just leave it at you should contact ICE in terms of how they're prioritizing this. Our job was to make sure that they were enforcing the laws and achieving the mission, protecting the nation, and I'll leave it at that. Q: Was that something that the White House had spoken with Secretary Kelly about? About expanding the definition of the individuals it would include? MR. SPICER: I would touch base with Secretary Kelly's office and then ICE. But our job was to give them -- the executive order and the guidance they put out I think is pretty explicit as far as describing how that executive order is going to be carried out. And then Secretary Kelly lays out very specifically how they're going to achieve that. So if you look at the factsheet and the letters that he put out, I think it lays it out pretty well. Q: Is the President hoping to have this executive order on immigration done before the joint session to Congress? And can you talk a little bit about -- you've talked about the delay in it is related to the fact that there's been more communication with other agencies to make sure this is rolled out appropriately. Can you talk about what -- I mean, what is the President looking for to get from these agencies? MR. SPICER: I think we're just trying to make sure that it is done precisely with a precision that he expects to make sure that we achieve the goal of the executive order when it's issued. Q: Sean, on healthcare, there's a new executive -- a new draft bill, a draft proposal that's been circulating on Capitol Hill that's now been made public that, for example, shrinks Medicaid expansion, scales back subsidies, et cetera. Is this something the President would support? MR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into what we are or are not going to support. That's my understanding, from media reports, is that that's a House draft and I would respectfully ask that you follow up with them. Q: Real quick yes or no. The President said at CPAC this morning that we're going to see the biggest buildup of the military in American history. Can we take that to the bank? Is that a real promise? Or is that -- MR. SPICER: I think you can take what the President says to the bank. Thank you, guys. I've got to get downstairs. Q: One more question just about the idea that it seems as though you're playing favorites with media outlets by excluding some from this conversation. MR. SPICER: You're my favorite. (Laughter.)  Q: No, that's not what I'm asking. But do you have a response to that, though, given that that is a concern to some that want to see press have access to you, all out? MR. SPICER: No, I think that -- right -- I think that we have shown an abundance of accessibility. We've brought more reporters into this process. And the idea that every time that every single person can't get their question answered or fit in a room that we're excluding people -- we've actually gone above and beyond with making ourselves, our team and our briefing room, more accessible than probably any prior administration. So I think you can take that to the bank. When you look at --  Q: But why not those other outlets today? MR. SPICER: Because, Cecilia, there's 3,000 people that are credentialed to come in here. Q: But there are six outlets that want to be in here right now. The New York Times --  MR. SPICER: No, there's not. Actually, that is false. To say that there are six -- maybe six that reached out to you, but that is not --  Q: Well, but --  MR. SPICER: No, no, hold on --  Q: -- listed in the White House Correspondents' Association's response to this. MR. SPICER: I understand that. There are way more than six that wanted to come in. We started with the pool and then we expanded it. So I get it. But why -- I can ask -- there are plenty that want to come in at all times for every event. We do what we can to be accessible. And if there's a problem with that, I understand it. But we do what we can to accommodate the press. I think we've gone above and beyond when it comes to accessibility and openness and getting folks to -- our officials, our team. And so, respectfully, I disagree with the premise of the question. Thank you. END 2:18 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-02-27,"1:43 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Wow, that's a crowd. I hope everyone had a great weekend. Good afternoon. Before I begin, I wanted to introduce the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, to talk to you a bit about the President's budget. When Director Mulvaney is finished, we will allow him to take a few questions and then resume the briefing and all the fun that goes with it. So without any further ado, Director Mulvaney. DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Thanks very much. I want to talk for a few minutes about the budget blueprint that most of you know the President started speaking about this morning with the governors. I'll talk a little bit about what it is and what it isn't, and then talk about where we are in the budget process and what it looks like from here. First of all, what this isn't: This is not a full-blown budget. That will not come until May. So you're not going to see anything in here that has to do with mandatory spending, entitlement reforms, tax policies, revenue projections, or the infrastructure plan. This blueprint was never going to be that, as I made clear during my Senate confirmation. It is a topline number only. As for what it is, these are the President's policies, as reflected in topline discretionary spending. To that end, it is a true America-first budget. It will show the President is keeping his promises and doing exactly what he said he was going to do when he ran for office. It prioritizes rebuilding the military, including restoring our nuclear capabilities; protecting the nation and securing the border; enforcing the laws currently on the books; taking care of vets; and increasing school choice. And it does all of that without adding to the currently projected FY 2018 deficit. The top line defense discretionary number is $603 billion. That's a $54-billion increase -- it's one of the largest increases in history. It's also the number that allows the President to keep his promise to undo the military sequester. The topline nondefense number will be $462 billion. That's a $54-billion savings. It's the largest-proposed reduction since the early years of the Reagan administration. The reductions in nondefense spending follow the same model -- it's the President keeping his promises and doing exactly what he said he was going to do. It reduces money that we give to other nations, it reduces duplicative programs, and it eliminates programs that simply don't work.  The bottom line is this: The President is going to protect the country and do so in exactly the same way that every American family has had to do over the last couple years, and that's prioritize spending.  The schedule from here -- these numbers will go out to the agencies today in a process that we describe as passback. Review from agencies are due back to OMB over the course of the next couple days, and we'll spend the next week or so working on a final budget blueprint. We expect to have that number to Congress by March 16th. That puts us on schedule for a full budget -- including all the things I mentioned, this one does not include -- with all the larger policy issues in the first part of May.  So with that, I'll take a couple questions. Yes, sir. Q: Mr. Director, in order to get to your topline on the rest of the nondiscretionary -- or rest of the discretionary budget, if you're not going to touch veterans benefits, you need to slice about 12 percent off of the rest of government. Can't you do that without affecting the services the government provides for -- DIRECTOR MULVANEY: And that's part of what this process is this week. The numbers go out, and the numbers -- each agency will get its topline number along with recommendations from OMB as to how we think they can hit that number. And they may come back to us and say, yeah, we think that's a good way to reach that number, or they may come back to us with other suggestions. That's what this process is. I think it's fairly unusual for us to be coming to you this early in the process, but we wanted to let everybody know exactly where we were. Q: But we're not talking about 2 or 3 percent -- we're talking about double-digit reductions, and that's a lot. DIRECTOR MULVANEY: There's going to be a lot of programs that -- again, you can expect to see exactly what the President said he was going to do. Foreign aid, for example -- the President said we're going to spend less money overseas and spend more of it here. That's going to be reflected in the number we send to the State Department. Q: Thank you very much. One quick follow on foreign aid. That accounts for less than 1 percent of overall spending. And I just spoke with an analyst who said even if you zero that out, it wouldn't pay for one year of the budget increases that are being proposed right now. So how do you square that amount? So why not tackle entitlements, which are the biggest driver, especially when a lot of Republicans over the years have said that they need to be taxed? DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Sure. On your foreign aid, it's the same answer I just gave, which is, yes, it's a fairly part of the discretionary budget, but it's still consistent with what the President said. When you see these reductions, you'll be able to tie it back to a speech the President gave or something the President has said previously. He's simply going to -- we are taking his words and turning them into policies and dollars. So we will be spending less overseas and spending more back home. I forgot your second question. Q: On entitlements, why not address entitlements, which is the biggest driver of spending? DIRECTOR MULVANEY: It's very unusual to -- this is a budget blueprint -- what some folks used to call a skinny budget -- and it would not be at all unusual for larger policy decisions, including tax reform, revenue projections not to be included in this budget. That will come in --  Q: Down the line? Q: Sir -- Q: Hold on. So down the line, could we see some type of budget that deals with entitlements? DIRECTOR MULVANEY: The full budget will contain the entire spectrum of the President's proposed policy changes. Q: Director, on rebuilding the military, can you talk a little bit about more of the breakdown of that? Can you go into a little bit more detail? DIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, I can't -- because, again, where we are in this process is that the numbers going to the DOD today and over the course of the next 10 days to two weeks, we'll be coming up with those types of details. I've got time for one more. Q: Will you be asking the military -- you're going to increase the military budget, but are you going to at least ask the people in the Defense Department to take a look at their budget and say, hey, where can we at least cut or at least look and make sure that we're spending the right amount of money? Is part of that is going to be part of the process? DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Well, absolutely. That's part of what Secretary Mattis and I have already talked. He's interested in driving more efficiencies into the Defense Department. OMB is also going to be involved with him on the procurement process. All of that will be incorporated in our larger budget in May. Q: So it's not just like a blanket -- ""Here, we're going to throw money at you, do what you want""? DIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, sir. No, sir.  Last one. Q: Does this account for spending for the President's wall, either in the $30 billion we've heard you're going to request for this year or the $54 billion increase? Does that include money for the wall, how to pay for the wall? DIRECTOR MULVANEY: It would be more likely -- excuse me, a little bit of both. We do expect to include some money in a future supplemental for 2017 for the wall, and a 2018 budget will also contain some longer-term dollars for that. Q: So it will be split up between the two. DIRECTOR MULVANEY: I believe that to be the case. Thank you all very much. MR. SPICER: Thank you, Director. So let me get back to -- I'll be right there in a second, April.  This morning, the President dropped by the National Governors Association meeting, where 49 governors from both states and territories joined Cabinet members and senior White House staff to discuss where they can work together to rebuild the country and restart the economy. While at the meeting, the President delivered a statement on his forthcoming budget proposal, which he'll submit March 16th, as you just heard the Director mention. The President's budget will, first and foremost, keep Americans safe. That means investing in both our nation's physical and financial security. We will rebuild the nation's military. An increase in defense spending, including increased funding for our veterans and our border, will be matched by equal reductions in nondefense programs. The savings in our budget will come from looking at outdated and duplicative programs. The reductions spending will be sensible and rational, but they will also be tough.  With our nation's debt spiraling out of control, we simply must take a look at the way we're spending taxpayers' dollars. Families across the country are being forced to make difficult choices, because for too long the federal government has not treated their money with the respect they deserve. The national debt exploded under the last administration from $10.6 billion [trillion] on January 20th, 2009 to $19.9 trillion the day before -- sorry, those are both trillions -- the day before the President's -- President Trump's inaugural. Every child born in America this year will inherit an average of over $60,000 in debt. And that, frankly, is too much.  Our budget will restore respect for taxpayers' dollars while funding all the necessary programs to keep our country safe and prospering. This meeting with the governors was a continuation of a weekend of engagement and discussion between the governors and the administration. The President and the First Lady welcomed the governors last night to the White House for the Annual Governors Ball. And yesterday, the Vice President had a very productive meeting with several governors. The administration is proud to be working with the governors on rebuilding our nation's infrastructure, reforming our healthcare system, and putting Americans back to work. I know that Obamacare, in particular, was put into place without a lot of input from governors. We're committed to consulting and including them on this and so many other subjects as we solve the nation's biggest issues together. Later this morning, the President had a listening session with some of our country's leading healthcare insurance companies. Interestingly, on yesterday's ABC ""This Week,"" Minority Leader Pelosi actually laid out a great outline of how to judge Obamacare's success based on what it was supposed to achieve. She said, ""It had three goals: One, to lower the cost, the other to expand benefits, and the third to improve and increase access."" So let's go through her criteria. Lowering costs: While this year all four tiers of Obamacare insurance plans are facing double-digit increases in average premiums. Just to take a look at one set of premiums, for standard silver plans in the states, 63 percent increase in Tennessee, 69 percent increase in Oklahoma, and a staggering 116 percent increase in Arizona. On expanding benefits: In reality, the new law's mandates have led to max cancellations of coverage, soaring out-of-pocket costs, and declining enrollment figures. Millions are choosing to pay a tax over buying the government-mandate insurance.  Increased access: With insurance fleeing the marketplace, Americans are facing a dwindling number of insurance choices with 17 percent of Americans left with only one insurer option available in their exchange. Insurers will be indispensable partners in the transition period out of Obamacare into the Patients First plan the President will be working with Congress to put in its place. The President's plan will encourage innovation, modernize our healthcare system, and provide immediate relief, and ensure access to quality, truly affordable care. This afternoon, the President had lunch with Vice President Pence and Ambassador Haley. Afterwards, he's having a meeting with Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell. And then following that, he's going to be meeting with Secretary of State Tillerson. The Secretary is coming off a very successful trip to Mexico that -- he was joined by Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly. I'm sure the President is looking forward to discussing that trip with the Secretary. Also this afternoon, the Vice President will be speaking to an extraordinary group of 60 presidents of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. There will be a pool spray at the top of the event, and the Vice President's office will release his remarks and photos following the event. We can also expect a meeting with the President with them as well. This evening, the President will have dinner with regional press affiliates that are going to be in town for the joint session of Congress. While it's tradition for representatives from the networks to meet with the President before his joint address, this is the first time, to my knowledge at least, that the opportunity has been expanded to include representation from 18 regional outlets from around the country. Tomorrow, the President will also have the traditional lunch with the network anchors. Beyond the so-called ""big five"" networks, we've also opened it up and invited outlets including Telemundo, Univision, CBN, EWTN, OANN, PBS, C-SPAN, and TV1.  Tonight, the President looks forward to seeing his nominee for the Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, confirmed by the Senate. Secretary-designate Ross has been an important champion for U.S.-struggling industries in the private sectors. And pending his confirmation this evening, he'll now do in the same post on behalf of the American people what he has done in private sector. Assuming everything goes according to the plan in the Senate tonight, we expect to have his swearing-in tomorrow here at the White House.  Also tomorrow, the President will deliver his first address to both houses of Congress. In his speech, the President will lay out an optimistic vision for the country, crossing traditional lines of party, race, socioeconomic status. As I said before, the theme will be the renewal of the American spirit. He will invite Americans of all backgrounds to come together in the service of a stronger and brighter future for our nation. In addition to laying out the concrete steps the President has already taken to make the American Dream possible for all of our people, he will talk about the bold agenda -- he wants to work with Congress. This includes tax and regulatory reform to provide relief to hardworking Americans and their businesses, making the workplace better for working parents, ensuring the families who have suffered under Obamacare's skyrocketing rates see it replaced with a patient-centered alternative, making sure every child in America has access to a good education, a rebuilding of our military and fulfilling of our commitments to veterans to whom we obviously owe a great deal of gratitude. You can expect to see a speech grounded firmly in solving real problems for every American -- how can we make sure that every American who needs a better job get one, how can we get kids who are trapped in failing schools into better ones, how we can keep gangs and drug violence out of our neighborhoods and communities. The President will address the Americans who have been waiting for help from their leaders for too long, and let them know that help is finally on the way. With respect to the speech, we will be having a background briefing sometime this evening here in the briefing room. We will provide additional details later in the afternoon.  As you might already know, the Department of Defense presented its preliminary plan to the White House today to defeat ISIS. This plan has been delivered by Secretary Mattis, who is currently briefing the principals on the option presented today in seeking their input and feedback. Finally, I wanted to note the President continues to be deeply disappointed and concerned by the reports of further vandalism at Jewish community -- Jewish cemeteries, rather. The cowardly destruction in Philadelphia this weekend comes on top of similar accounts from Missouri and threats made to Jewish community centers around the country. The President continues to condemn these and any other form of anti-Semitic and hateful acts in the strongest terms. From our country's founding, we've been dedicated to protecting the freedom of our citizens' rights to worship. No one in America should feel afraid to follow the religion of their choosing freely and openly. The President is dedicated to preserving this originating principle of our nation.  And while we're at it, I don't want to get ahead of the law enforcement, but I was asked the other day about the story in Kansas -- the shooting in Kansas. And while the story is evolving, early reports out of Kansas are equally disturbing.  So with that, I'll be glad to take your questions. Jon. Q: Sean, there's a report this morning that you reached out directly to CIA Director Pompeo. Did you directly contact Director Pompeo and ask him to knock down the New York Times story on the Russia connection? MR. SPICER: Thanks, Jon. Let me kind of, if I may, walk through the entire timeline. I think it's important. As I mentioned I think a week ago, the New York Times published a story about what they called ""contacts"" between members of the Trump campaign and Russian officials. The FBI deputy director was at a meeting here at the White House that morning. After the meeting concluded, he asked the chief of staff to stand back a second, he wanted to tell him that the report in the New York Times was ""BS."" For viewers at home, I think you can pretty much figure what that means, but I'll leave it at that. At that time, the chief of staff said, thank you for sharing that with me, can we let other people know that the story is not accurate. Throughout the day, they went back and forth to see what they thought was appropriate. Finally, came to the conclusion that they did not want to get in the process of knocking down every story that they had issues with.  They then -- we then were informed that other people had come to the same conclusions, including -- at that time, Chairman Devin Nunes had told us, hey, I've been knocking this down, telling reporters. We shared a number with him of a reporter that had contacted us. And again, when the reporters contact us and we said, no, that's not -- to the best of our knowledge that's not true, they were asking us, can you point to -anybody else that can substantiate this? And I think we did a good job of saying, sure, we will share with reporters other people who have come to the same conclusion.  So I won't go into the specifics. I will say that I think we did our job very effectively by making sure that reporters who had had questions about the accuracy and the claims made in The New York Times, that we were pointing them to subject-matter experts who understood whether or not that story was accurate or not. And I think just to continue to be very, very clear on this -- it was about the accuracy of the reporting and the claims that were made in there, plain and simple -- about whether or not a story that appeared in The New York Times was accurate. And individual after individual continued to say that, as far as they knew, they weren't.  I think most of you probably saw Chairman Nunes's comments this morning. He was very clear, number one, that he reached out to us to say, I've been telling people, reporters, that these allegations and descriptions in The New York Times are not accurate. And then we shared that information with him. But he came to us to share that he equally had that issue brought up to him, he was briefed and saw ""no evidence"" that the story was accurate.  So the answer is, we have continued to give reporters information and sources that went to the accuracy, or lack thereof, of a report that was in a newspaper. And I think Chairman Nunes also equally said it's interesting how we literally were engaging with the press, saying, if you have a question about the sourcing on this -- obviously, when brought to our attention, we said, it's not accurate as we know, but then most of you and your colleagues who had inquired would say, well, that's great, I'm sure you're saying this, but who else can corroborate this? So our job was to continue to -- when informed -- share sources who had equally come to the same conclusion that the Times story was not accurate.  Q: You don't think there's something strange about -- something odd about the White House Press Secretary getting the CIA director on the phone to knock down a story about an investigation? MR. SPICER: No, no, but see, respectfully, you're using words like ""knock down."" There was a story in a newspaper -- Q: Was it disputed? MR. SPICER: Hold on. No, no -- there was reporters coming to us saying, there is a story out there, what's your take on it? And our answer was, we don't believe it's accurate, we don't* [do] believe it's false. But obviously that's our take on it. And reporters were saying to us, well, is there anybody that you can point to to substantiate this claim?  Now, remember, this all started with the FBI coming to us, bringing to our attention, saying that the story in the Times was not accurate -- in fact, it was BS -- and all we did was simply say, that's great, could you tell other reporters the same thing you're telling us? And I would think that other reporters, yourself included, would think that that would be a helpful thing to get the story straight. All we sought to do was to actually get an accurate report out. And again, I think Chairman Nunes this morning, over and over and over and over again, made it very clear that no evidence that has been brought to his attention suggests that that reporting was accurate. So, respectfully, I think it's interesting that I'm being asked what's appropriate when what we're doing is actually urging reporters to engage with subject-matter experts who can corroborate whether or not something is accurate or not. Q: Should there be a special prosecutor? Darrell Issa has called for a special prosecutor to look into this. MR. SPICER: And I guess my question would be, a special prosecutor for what? Q: To look into the whole Russia connection, the whole Russia influencing -- MR. SPICER: And here's my -- right. And I guess my -- Q: I mean, he was part of the campaign, so -- I mean, Sessions was part of the campaign, the Attorney General. MR. SPICER: I understand. But here's my question, Jonathan: We have now for six months heard story after story come out about unnamed sources say the same thing over and over again, and nothing has come of it, right? We've heard the same people, the same anecdotes, and we've heard reports over and over again. And as Chairman Nunes made very clear today, he has seen nothing that corroborates that. So at what point -- you got to ask yourself, what are you investigating?  Q: Well, Russian interference -- I mean, beyond the context. MR. SPICER: No, and I think that both the House and the Senate have looked at it. You know as well as I do that the intelligence community has looked at it as well. There's a big difference. I think that Russia's involvement in activity has been investigated up and down. So the question becomes at some point, if there's nothing to further investigate, what are you asking people to investigate?  I mean, Chairman Nunes spoke very clearly today when asked over and over and over again about all of this, and said that he has seen nothing that leads him to believe that there's there. The President has spoken forcefully time and time again that he has no interests in Russia, he hasn't talked to people in Russia in years, and yet you keep asking -- and when I say ""you,"" collectively -- to try to find something that seemingly, at least the reporting that I'm seeing in different organizations, suggests that there's nothing new that's being reported. It's the same stuff over and over again that we've heard for literally six months. And so the question becomes at some point, what do you need to further investigate if there is nothing that has come out? Q: Can you not categorically deny there were no contacts between the Russians and anybody on the campaign? MR. SPICER: I can't deny -- I can't -- I guess my question is -- Q: That's what the investigation would look at. MR. SPICER: Right. And I guess my point is, is that you've had the intelligence community look at Russia's involvement in the election. You had the House and Senate both do the same. And so what I'm trying to ascertain is that at what point -- how many people have to say that there's nothing there before you realize there's nothing there? I can't say unequivocally -- all I'm saying is, the people who have done the investigating about Russia overall and its activities in the United States, specifically now with respect to our election, haven't provided anything that leads me to believe or should lead you to believe -- and I continue to see reports coming from -- there were media sources saying when they checked in with law enforcement, or intelligence community sources, there's nothing more than has been previously reported over and over again. So, at some point, you do have to ask yourself, what are you actually looking for? How many times do you have to come to the same conclusion before you take the answer? And that's where I -- Mara. Q: Just to be clear, did you -- just to follow up on that, did you personally reach out to Pompeo?  MR. SPICER: I'm not going to discuss what we did internally. I'm just going to say that when we shared -- we did our job about making sure that when people had -- reporters had questions, we let them know what subject-matter experts were available to discuss the accuracy of the newspaper story. Mara. Q: Yeah, I'm sure people will come back to this, but I actually have a budget question, which is: During the campaign, the President said he was not going to touch Medicare or Social Security. His Treasury Secretary repeated that. It sounded like the OMB Director was leaving that as an open question, TBD. I'm just wondering, what's the state of the promise? That we won't touch it for current retirees -- MR. SPICER: What the OMB Director made clear is how it works. The budget is dealing with the topline discretionary numbers. Policy decisions are not part of the budget. That was what he was being asked and what he -- so I just want to be clear in terms of what it was. And again, I think -- Q: -- the state of the promise. In other words what is the promise.  MR. SPICER: Right. And I think the state of the promise is clear. And I think, as you point out, he had made the promise, he stands by the promise. The Treasury Secretary -- Q: But what is the promise? Current retirees? People near retirement? Anybody paying into -- MR. SPICER: I will follow up specifically on that. But I think the President has made very clear that it's not his intent to do -- he wants to focus on the discretionary side; that entitlement reform is not -- that, with respect to those programs that he mentioned, he stands by his word. Fred. Q: I wanted to ask a couple issues. An executive order on religious freedom had previously been in the works. Will that still come? And if it does, will it extend beyond religious freedom? MR. SPICER: I'm sorry, Fred, what? Q: Will it extend beyond the Johnson Amendment? MR. SPICER: I think we've discussed executive orders in the past, and for the most part we're not going to get into discussing what may or may not come until we're ready to announce it. So I'm sure as we move forward we'll have something. Olivier. Q: Thanks, Sean.  Q: I'm sorry, just one more. The issue of types of reforms. Will there be -- how committed is the administration to a border adjustment tax? And is there any concern that there won't be enough conservative support for that; that it could block any meaningful tax reform long-term?  MR. SPICER: Well, I'm not going to get into the specifics of tax reform today. The President has made clear that we'll have an outline of the plan very soon. But what I will say is that I think he has talked about the concerns that he has with current regulatory and tax policy that benefit people from moving out of the country and shipping jobs -- or products back in while shedding American workers. He will continue to fight for policies that promote manufacturing and job creation in the United States, and supports American workers.  So I don't want to get ahead of the exact nature of the policy. He has been seeking a lot of input. As I mentioned earlier, he's going to talk today with Speaker Ryan and Senator McConnell. I know that both the joint session, the status of repeal and replace, and I'm sure some discussion of tax reform will probably come up. But there's a lot -- we're continuing to move forward and work with them. Olivier. Q: Thanks. A couple on the ISIS strategy. Can you just get to the timetable from now, now that you received it -- what happens? And there's a report that you're asking for $30 billion in emergency defense spending on top of the $54 [billion] in the budget. Is that true? Does that cover the new ISIS strategy? Can you explain what's different between the two? MR. SPICER: Thank you. Right now, literally, that principals meeting -- or principals meeting that I mentioned at the beginning is happening as we speak. So Secretary Mattis was coming over to brief the principals as far as the ISIS plan. And again, part of it was to make sure that he fully discusses the recommendations that he's making and seek the input and feedback of the other principals downstairs. That can help guide where we go from here, how we go. With respect to the funding, I think Director Mulvaney noted that there will be a supplemental at some point. Right now the focus is on the budget, and then we'll go from there. John Gizzi. Q: Thank you, Sean. Two brief questions. First, I read your statement at the Thursday briefing to Governor Malloy of Connecticut during the NGA meeting. And he responded -- and I quote -- ""Sean didn't read a thing that I said."" He said that he -- in Connecticut, they are already working to get criminals who are in the country illegally out. His objection was to going into warming centers or schools where officials might frighten children. Your response to the Governor on that? MR. SPICER: Well, again, I was asked specifically what his stance -- what the comments were with respect to sanctuary cities. And again, I would reiterate, with all due respect to the Governor, I'm not here to pick a fight with the Governor. I enjoyed my time going to school in the state of Connecticut. I have a kind affection of the Nutmeg State. But the reality is, I think that there's a difference. Whether or not what he wants to do is state funds, maybe -- without knowing the exact nature of how he's funding, what he's funding, it's difficult. The question I was asked at the time was on how we would be handling it. And I think the answer, whether it's Connecticut or California, is that the President's executive order and the President's commitment is to make sure that tax dollars are not used to support programs that are helping people who are not in the country legally and who are not citizens entitled to them. Q: One more question, Sean. MR. SPICER: Okay. Starting early. (Laughter.)  Q: For 58 years, when Presidents have gone to Rome, they've always met the Pope, going back to when President Eisenhower met Pope John XXIII. Now, one year ago this week, candidate Trump had a disagreement with this Pope and an exchange of words. When he goes to Rome in May for his first European trip, will he meet with this Pope? MR. SPICER: That's a great question. Obviously, I would be a huge fan of that. But I'm not going to -- I don't think we're at that place in the planning process to make an announcement on any visits with the Pope. Blake. Q: Sean, thank you. Two budget questions, if you don't mind. Mr. Mulvaney, I believe, just said that what the administration plans on putting forward doesn't add to the current deficit projection, which the CBO says is about $560 billion. But he didn't say that it would significantly draw from that either. So my first question is, is the administration comfortable putting something forward that might rack up deficits of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars? MR. SPICER: Well, I think -- I'm trying to understand the question a little, if you can help me with this. Because he -- Q: He said it wasn't going to add to it. MR. SPICER: Right. Q: So my question is, he didn't necessarily say it was going to cut from it, either. If it doesn't cut from it, potentially it could be hundreds of billions in deficit. And I'm curious --  MR. SPICER: Right, no, but I think -- correct me if I'm wrong -- I mean, he basically made it very clear it doesn't add to the projected baseline deficit. So that continues to be the goal. And I think as we continue to work through this process, the passback, you know, it can work both ways. We could identify further savings and reductions through working with the agencies and departments, but we're going to make sure that the topline number we maintain is as close to that as possible. And as we go through this -- I mean, this is the beginning of the process as the director noted. We send the number to the department or the agency, give them some ideas, how we came up with this, and then they come back to us and either justify why a particular program or office, or what have you, needs to stay in existence or why maybe not the reduction that is offered. But it's a back-and-forth process that will occur over the next few weeks. So to get ahead of it is the problem. Q: Let me ask you what Nancy Pelosi -- to just get a quick reaction to Nancy Pelosi. She put out a statement and said the following: ""Five weeks into his administration, President Trump has not introduced a single jobs bill."" Your reaction to that would be what? MR. SPICER: He's created a lot of jobs. I think that's -- he's continuing to work with Congress on both repealing and replacing Obamacare, tax reform. And, fundamentally, both of those two items alone I think can help spur a lot of economic growth. The meetings that we've had with the CEOs, the health insurers -- there are so many things that are both job-killing and that can be done to help promote a better regulatory and tax climate that lead to job creation. I think that's one of the biggest problems right now is that people in Washington aren't necessarily talking to job creators and saying, what is the impediment that you have to hiring more American workers? What are the impediments that you have to manufacturing more, to building here? The meetings and the actions that the President has taken on both regulatory and other matters have helped spur job creation. You've heard these companies come in over and over again -- the automakers, airlines, Sprint -- I mean, the list goes on and on and on of people saying to the President, because of your agenda, because of your vision, we're willing to commit to hiring additional people to manufacturing more. That's how jobs are created -- it's not through the government. And too often, it's the government regulations that stifle and prevent job creation. And I think the President, as a businessman, fully appreciates and understands how this works and what some of those impediments do to creating jobs and to growing the economy. And so I would just say that you haven't seen anything yet. It's going to continue to be the case. Trey. Q: Thanks, Sean. Is there concern in the administration that a large-scale military buildup will appear threatening to other countries around the world and lead to some sort of arms race with other countries? MR. SPICER: No, I think when you look at the state of some of the infrastructure in our military, whether it's the age of our ships or our planes or some of the other hardware that exists, you recognize that we need to rebuild a lot of these things. The size of our Navy has gone down significantly. And there are new needs and new -- and when you look at the commitment that you have to make not just in one year but in several years, for a lot of these programs -- ships and tanks, even weapons systems -- they don't get built in a month or a day. You have to make a commitment early on to make the investment because of the time that it takes to procure them, to build them, the research and development that goes into it. And so I would just suggest to you that this is the first step in making sure we make the commitment to a military that through, especially through the sequester the last few years, has not gotten the funding it needs to get off life support. There are a lot of things that are being taken care of for the military where they're just continuing to -- they're not putting the systems and the projects in place to allow the military to keep up with the times, and that's a problem. Major. Q: Sean, one investigation question and one budget question. As you may be aware, Bill Owens, the father of William ""Ryan"" Owens, gave an interview with the Miami Herald over the weekend and he said, ""The government owes my son an investigation."" On behalf of the President of the United States, is the President open to an investigation to the raid in Yemen? And the father of Ryan Owens called that a ""stupid"" mission. Is there something that you'd like to communicate to him about that mission that might persuade him otherwise? MR. SPICER: Yeah, thank you. That's multi-part, so let me kind of walk through it slowly. First of all, I can't possibly imagine what he's going through in terms of the loss of his son. I can tell him that on behalf of the President, his son died a hero and the information that he was able to help obtain through that raid, as I've said before, is going to safe American lives. It's going to protect our country more. So he made a sacrifice to this country. He was on his 12th deployment. And I know that his wife, when she spoke to the President, knows that he did this because he loved it, he cared about our nation. And the mission was successful in helping prevent a future attack or attacks on this nation. It obtained a lot of information that will help us keep safe. With respect to his request, it is standard operating procedure for the Department of Defense to undergo what they call a 15-6 review. That review, in this case, is three-pronged. Because there was a fatality and a loss of life, there's that. Because there were civilians involved, that's another. And then third is because there was hardware -- a helicopter that was damaged. That is a separate. So, in fact, there will be three reviews done by the Department of Defense because of the nature of this.  But, again, I can't stress enough that on behalf of the President, on behalf of this nation, we express our condolences, extend our prayers to him during this time. Q: As you said, that is standard procedure. Is there anything the President is particularly curious about with this mission, in that it was brought to him, he authorized it quickly? Does he believe in the main it was carried out well and there's nothing that he's particularly curious about in the way either the helicopter was damaged, fatality, the civilian casualties -- anything of the like? MR. SPICER: Well, number one, I've walked through the timetable previously in terms of how long this had been planned for, dating well back into the previous administration. And as you know, their recommendation at the time was to wait for a moonless night. That night wasn't going to occur during President Obama's administration. And so when General Mattis got into the Department of Defense, he was briefed up on the status of the thing, made aware of when the next time was go. We went through the process to ensure that we continued to believe that the mission -- the way it was going to be conducted and the results of the mission would be worthy of action.  The conclusion continued to be, as it was prior, that we should move forward. As I mentioned before, I think you can't ever say that, when there's most importantly loss of life and people injured, that it's 100 percent successful. But I think when you look at what the stated goal of that mission was -- it was an information- and intelligence-gathering mission. And it achieved its objectives. So, again, I would express our thoughts and our prayers and our condolences to all of the people in Chief Owens's family and his friends, his shipmates. But it's something that, as a SEAL and as somebody who deployed 12 times, he knew that this was part of the job and he knew what he was doing. And so we're very comfortable with how the mission was executed, and we'll let the Department of Defense go through that review process and then see where that leads us. But I think to get ahead of the three separate reviews that are being done by the Department of Defense would be probably a little irresponsible at this time. Q: Sean -- MR. SPICER: Major gets two, too.  Q: Just real quick on the budget. As you're aware, to undo the defense sequester, you have to get 60 votes in the Senate because you have a separate domestic sequester number and defense. Are you confident with these numbers and with this kind of heavy discretionary spending cut proposed, you can get the 60 votes to change the law? Because without that change in law, the proposal is just that -- it doesn't become operational. MR. SPICER: I think that when it comes to our nation's security, specifically our nation's military, I don't think that it's a partisan issue. I think that senators from across the country -- whether you're talking about Florida or whether you've got an Army installation or a Navy base, you understand the state of repair that many of our planes, ships and other hardware is in. And I think that there is a bipartisan commitment to give the military and its members the equipment and the tools it needs to succeed and protect this country. So I do feel confident. April. Q: Sean, I have a couple of budgetary questions for you. One, at the press conference, President Trump talked about the fix for inner cities. What is the investment in this budget when it comes to a fix for inner cities? MR. SPICER: It's a good try. I think the Director was very clear --  Q: That's one -- MR. SPICER: I mean, part of the process today was to start that passback process that he talked about, where we're going to the various departments, whether it's HUD or DOT, and giving them that topline number and then hearing back. So I don't want to get into a specific number with you before we get too far down the process. I think that's a conversation that we're going to have with the agencies and then we will have subsequently with Congress when they start drafting their resolutions. Q: Okay, a follow-up on this, but I do have a question on HBCUs. See, he talked about healthcare. He talked about education and he talked about crime. He needs to talk about Chicago and law enforcement. So you don't have any kind of budgetary numbers when it comes to it? And healthcare is a piece that is one of the line items for this budget. MR. SPICER: That's right. And I'm not saying that we don't have numbers. I'm saying that we're not giving them out. That's a big difference. Q: (Inaudible.) MR. SPICER: I know. (Laughter.) You're going to do a good job trying. (Laughter.) But as the Director noted on this, that they have come up with topline numbers based on their going through each of these agencies' budget, and saying, hey, there's a duplicative program here. In some cases, maybe they give them more, maybe they give them less. Part of it is to begin that conversation, that process, with the departments and agencies to figure out what those investments are. Maybe it's repurposing existing funds in a different way.  So it's not necessarily a zero-sum game. There is a way that a department can reallocate money to a program that might end up benefitting because there is a duplicative or out-of-date program or office that that savings could be applied to something. But I don't want to get ahead of the process right now, only to say that we are at the very beginning of it. Q: And one on HBCUs. MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: The President is going to see the 80-plus presence of HBCUs with the Vice President today. Some of them are very concerned as to what this executive order looks like, and they are waiting to hear the commitment before they say, ""I'm all in."" What is the commitment that this President is trying to make when it comes to HBCUs to ensure, I guess, their future, or deal with funding for research projects, what have you, or moving it out of the Department of Education to the purview of the White House? What is the commitment that he's going to give to them? MR. SPICER: So, look, I don't generally speak about executive orders until they're finalized. I will just say that one of the things that I think there's commitment from this White House to do is to look at the various resources throughout the federal government that support HBCUs. So, for example, the Department of Defense has ROTC and NROTC programs. Are they being properly -- is that funding being properly executed and spent. There's programs within each of the departments -- the Department of Education, the Department of Housing and Urban Development -- that affect grants or programs or direct funding that go to HBCUs for various different things, whether it's construction projects, or teaching programs, or mentorship programs. Whatever it is, they span throughout the entire government.  And I think that what we are committed to doing is ensuring that there is a high level of understanding and commitment, that goes straight to the President, of how we harness those resource within the government, and make sure that they're doing what they're supposed to be doing.  So it's one thing to have them, right, spread throughout the different departments. It's another thing to make sure that there's a direct pipeline to the President of the United States that those programs are being executed in a way that's benefitting the future of HBCUs and the various projects and teaching that goes on there. Q: And so what are you saying -- there's going to be a piece that is going to basically go throughout all the agencies to make sure that there is some kind of commitment to HBCUs and contract of like, let's say engineering for some schools, or in research for other schools? MR. SPICER: Yeah, I would say -- I think I'm going to stick to waiting until we announce it to get out a lot more.  Q: Is that today or tomorrow? MR. SPICER: I anticipate it very soon. How is that? I want to give myself a little wiggle room. Phil Rucker. Q: Yeah, Sean, thanks. A budget-related question, but on infrastructure. The President has repeatedly, including today, again, called for a major infrastructure plan to the tune a trillion dollars -- roads, bridges, tunnels, you name it. Can you explain where that money is going to come from, how it fits into the budget that's under review right now, and what the timeline for that project would be? MR. SPICER: So I think that would be part of a longer-term discussion that we're having with Congress. As you know, the President got in office 30-some-odd days ago. The idea of getting a budget is -- you know, it's commonly referred to as a skinny budget -- is to get the government to continue to be funding and it will be something that we'll work with Congress.  I understand your point. The President continues to talk about the status -- Q: -- a priority for him. MR. SPICER: It is. Absolutely. But I think that we've got to make sure that it's done right and that we work with Congress. I think, as you correctly mention, there's obviously a funding mechanism to this. And we've already talked about things like comprehensive tax reform that could add to that discussion.  And so I just -- I understand what you're asking in terms of how this would be funded and when it will be coming, and the pay-fors, but we're working with Congress to have that discussion. I think that comes probably outside of the budget discussion. Q: And so how does he square that with the need to tighten the belt, which he also talked about today -- we've been spending too much as a government and we need to cut our spending? MR. SPICER: Right, but I think -- but in the same manner that we're presenting the budget. So we're talking about adding $54 million -- $54 trillion, rather -- a billion dollars to -- thank you. Appreciate the help here. (Laughter.)  But we're looking to add that to defense. And so what it means is that we have to look through other programs to find reductions in savings. I think that same kind of discussion would happen with respect to infrastructure, not necessarily the savings piece, but the funding piece; that there's several ways -- and I know that there's a lot of discussion, private-public partnerships that he is started to have a discussion with in terms of the funding mechanism. And so all I'm trying to get at is that there are various ways to do this funding without just relying on the American taxpayer in terms of additional taxes. There are spending reductions, there are other funding mechanisms, and I think, in due course, we will get around to that discussion. Q: And just related to that, he mentioned in his remarks about infrastructure today that as he drives through the Queens-Midtown tunnel and the Lincoln tunnel, he worries about ceiling tiles falling. Is there a specific incident he was talking about where people have been injured, or is that just a fear of his? MR. SPICER: I don't know. I'll ask. (Laughter.) But I'm sure Secret Service will take care of the -- alleviating the medium concerns. Hold on. Alexis. Q: Sean, I have two questions. First, one on healthcare. Because the OMB director was signaling that the complete budget would be made ready early May, and the President today described how complicated he had discovered that the healthcare repeal and replace has become, can you describe when it is that the President would present his framework for an overhaul of healthcare? Is it going to be included in the budget so we would see it before May? MR. SPICER: I don't think you're going to see it in the budget, no. That's not the appropriate vehicle for it. I think I've mentioned it before. I think you would drive -- or at least the leading option, before I get locked into something, is to add Obamacare to the FY17 budget process and put it through reconciliation. So that would happen outside of the current budget structure. But I think he has also been very clear that he wants this outline within a matter of weeks, and that we continue to have these discussions with House and Senate leadership, with Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce, and then similar on Senate finance on the Senate side.  So when he talks to Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell today, I'm sure that conversation will continue.  Q: Just to follow up on healthcare, because not every ingredient in the Affordable Care Act can be handled in reconciliation. That's why I was asking about the elements of it that we see in the budget. MR. SPICER: That's right. Q: So we will see some of those? MR. SPICER: Well, there's several pieces of Obamacare. Some can be done by executive order, some get done with 50 votes, some have to be done specifically in reconciliation. I think counter to Major's point on a previous question, that there are certain things that have to be done in certain ways legislatively, and to create a comprehensive and holistic approach to both repealing it and replacing it. And we're aware of that. We're working with the House and the Senate to make that happen. Q: And my second topic. MR. SPICER: Of course. Q: All right. The immigration executive order, the travel ban -- is the President going to address the American people and Congress in his speech tomorrow night and specifically describe and defend the immigration ban? And when will we see the revised executive order? MR. SPICER: So we're not going to -- I would not anticipate the speech being a defense of legislation and executive orders. I don't think many previous Presidents have gotten through and used that as a legislative walkthrough.  But you will hear about his commitment to immigration and his desire for border security, and what it means not just about keeping the nation safe, but what impact it's having on the economy. So you will hear a lot about immigration tomorrow night, and he will talk about why it matters and the goal that we have and why we should come together on areas like this. Q: Can I follow up on that, Sean? MR. SPICER: Hold on. Katelyn. Q: Where's the next order? MR. SPICER: Oh, I'm sorry. The next order I think we should have it out probably middle of this week. Looking towards the middle of the week. And we'll have further updates as we get through the schedule. I think obviously our priority right now today was the really get the budget process kicked off, and then continue to prepare for the joint session. Katelyn. Q: Thank you. Q: Sean, can I follow on that? MR. SPICER: You will in a second. Q: An internal report in 2015 identified $125 billion in wasteful Pentagon spending. So how can you justify adding $54 billion to the defense budget? Is that going to go to hiring soldiers or bureaucrats or contractors? And is the President concerned with wasteful spending at the DOD? MR. SPICER: Of course he's concerned. He's concerned with wasteful spending throughout the government. But I think there's also a big difference between rooting out waste and fraud in various programs and offices, and understanding that when you're talking about adding to the fleet or increasing airplane costs, that that can't be driven just through those. And the commitment that you have to make to purchase some of those very-needed upgrades to our infrastructure and to our arsenal and to planes and ships doesn't just come through that. Because even if you could start to really identify, you really wouldn't be able to make the financial commitment that needs to be done to rebuild some of the ships and planes in particular that need a substantial investment on the front end. John. Q: If I could just follow on Alexis's question. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has just denied your request to suspend proceedings in regard to the initial executive order. That order came out just within the last few minutes. So do you plan to continue defending your first executive order in court? And what's the purpose of doing that as opposed to simply rescinding it and then rendering that case moot? MR. SPICER: Well, I haven't been able to read my phone while this has happened. So I -- Q: That's why I read -- MR. SPICER: (Laughter.) Thank you, I appreciate it. So with all due respect, I would ask that I be able to get back to you tomorrow on that after we consult with the Counsel's Office and go through the briefing and the -- excuse me, the reading of what the court has said. But give me a little time, let me get off the podium --  Q: I mean, the rescinding it question still stands, regardless of the -- MR. SPICER: I understand that, and I think that the President has made a commitment right now to continue to defend what we did.  Q: For what reason? MR. SPICER: Hold on. Because this is the strategy that -- he believes that we have the authority vested in U.S. code. I've talked about this extensively in the past. And I think that if you'll allow me, once we get done with the briefing, I will follow up with the Counsel's Office. Q: But the point that some of us are trying to understand is, if you have a new executive order that you believe addresses the concerns of the many courts who have weighed in on this, why continue to defend an executive order that --  MR. SPICER: Because he's -- I mean, because we were right the first time. And I think that --  Q: Are you trying to prove a point? MR. SPICER: Hold on -- no, but I think that it's not a question of proving a point. It's that the manner in which it was done in the first place was what we believe and continue to believe was the right way to address this problem.  And while the second executive order attempts to address the court's concerns that they made, the goal is obviously to maintain the way that we did it the first time because we believe that the law is very clear about giving the President the authority that he needs to protect the country.  So just dropping that is not necessarily the most prudent thing. And I think part of it is for us to recoup right now, figure out what the court has said, and then reassess the strategy. But I don't want to get ahead, as you point out, you're reading it to me now -- I would like the opportunity to maybe go read it and actually have a lawyer read it -- since that won't do very much. Go ahead. Q: Sean, thank you. On anti-Semitism, that was a good, strong statement. Is there anything that the federal government can do to protect Jewish institutions? Are there any leads who is doing this? And also on sequester, when can sequester be lifted? MR. SPICER: When can it be lifted? Q: Yes. MR. SPICER: I think we've got to go through the process to lift the sequester, and so we'll deal with that.  With respect to some of the activity that we've seen at Jewish cemeteries in particular -- look, I think we have to work with law enforcement at a local and state level. I'll leave it to the Department of Justice to comment further on what additional steps can be made. But I think -- as has been pointed out multiple times, I think one of the things that we can do is speak from this podium, in particular, and other places to make sure that every American understands what our values are, and that that kind of behavior and activity is wrong and won't be tolerated, and the highest levels of government denounce it. So I think it starts at that. And then I think there's a law enforcement component that I would ask you to touch base with. Q: Sean, two on the budget.  MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: I understand this is a blueprint. I understand the President has previously said he doesn't want to touch entitlements. But why does he think it's the right move to break with years of Republican orthodoxy, House Speaker Paul Ryan, who have said that any sensible long-term budget needs to include entitlement reform? MR. SPICER: Look, I'm just going to -- I think the President understands the commitment that was made to seniors in particular and that it's a sacred bond and a trust. And I think -- look, Mara asked this earlier -- I think let me get back to you on the specifics. But I think he made a commitment to the American people. And one of the things that I think the President continues to get high marks on is that regardless of whether you voted for him or not, or you agree with his policies, he's a man of his word. And he has followed up on the promises that he made to the American people. And I think that's important. Now, again, I think that we will continue to work with Congress. But the President understands that we have commitments that we've made on the entitlement side, in particular, and especially on the senior side with respect to Social Security that need to be maintained. And so he's going to keep this word to the American people.  Q: But if you talk to some economic analysts, they say Social Security, Medicare won't be there in a number of years if we don't address the fundamental problems. MR. SPICER: And I think that -- right. And so for right now, I think the budget that we're laying out deals on the discretionary side. You've heard the President's priorities and commitment, especially when it comes to protecting this country. And if we have anything further, I'll let you know.  Q: And one more -- Sean, one more. Is there an internal leak inquiry right now? MR. SPICER: Not that I'm aware of. Q: Thank you very much, Sean. I have two questions on U.S.-China relationship, if I may. MR. SPICER: You may. Q: Thank you. MR. SPICER: Everyone else gets two. Q: First of all, since President Trump took office, China sends it very first senior official, State Counselor Yang Jiechi, to visit Washington, D.C. today. Will there will be a meeting with in the White House, and what's the White House's expectation of his visit? MR. SPICER: So the State Counselor, and for those of you not schooled in the Chinese government, is basically the equivalent of our NSA Director -- NSC Director, correct?  Q: Yes. MR. SPICER: So the Ambassador and the State Counselor came today. They had a meeting with H.R. McMaster, Jared Kushner, and I think some others sat in on the meeting. They had a delegation of six people here. After the meeting ended, I believe the State Counselor was taken and had an opportunity to say hi to the President before he left. This is an opportunity to begin that conversation and talk to them on shared interests of national security. Q: Sean -- MR. SPICER: Sorry, hold on. He gets one more. Everybody else did.  Q: Can I have a follow up? MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on, hold on. Let me just -- everybody else got two. Q: Yes, just this morning, President Trump mentioned about his pick for ambassador to China, Governor -- MR. SPICER: Branstad. Q: Branstad. Governor Branstad apparently has a really positive view on China.  MR. SPICER: Yeah. Q: So how confident the President is on the Governor's confirmation to get all the support in the Senate?  MR. SPICER: Oh, I think he'll receive tremendous support -- bipartisan support. Governor Branstad has been -- is a true -- he has huge ties on both sides. I think he's one of the longest serving governors ever, definitely in Iowa. And I think that he has tremendous respect from both sides of the aisle not just for how he's handled himself as a governor in Iowa, but his deep understanding and ties to China and to China's economy and to Chinese officials. And I think he's going to do a phenomenal job representing our nation.  He starts with a deep understanding of the Chinese economy, the Chinese government, and that is going to really serve our nation well. Mara. Q: Can I just have a follow-up on China? Thank you. Because I know I got one before.  MR. SPICER: You did.  Q: I appreciate that. A lot of people voted for Donald Trump because they felt -- they agreed with him that the U.S. was getting ripped off by China. And after the election, he made the call to Taiwan, which he was praised for. Then he told Fox News -- he said, ""I don't know why we have to be bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade."" Then he reaffirmed the one-China policy. So what did he get in return from China for doing that? MR. SPICER: Well, he had a conversation with President Xi. I'm not going to get into the details of it. But at the President's -- President Xi's request and after a discussion, the President reaffirmed the one-China policy. The President is not one to discuss his negotiating tactics. So I --  Q: But did he get something? Can he assure the American people he got something?  MR. SPICER: The President always gets something. Ryan. Q: Well, what was it? What was it?  Q: Sean, two quick follow-ups. First of all, I noticed earlier today there were a lot of Republican governors out here but not very many Democratic governors. Is this administration actively attempting to reach out to the other side of the aisle for compromise? MR. SPICER: Yeah. I think if you saw the remarks during this pool opportunity, the President talked about some of the conversations he had with Governor McAuliffe in Virginia in particular. But they were here last night, they had dinner with their wives and husbands. It was an opportunity to really talk to the Cabinet and get to know each other and talk about priorities. I will say that -- it's interesting, I mentioned Obamacare. When one of the things that was brought up by the governors -- and I've got to be honest, I wasn't picking which governors and thinking of party -- but it came up over and over again that they actually -- several of them commented on how appreciative they have been in terms of seeking their input on not just healthcare but infrastructure and Medicaid, in particular, and other areas that fall into their thing -- to their wheelhouse. So I think -- just so we're clear, the dialogue that exists between this administration and this President and governors I think is a very refreshing move forward. Q: And then my point -- a follow-up, a quick follow-up. I want to clarify a little bit of something that happened Thursday and Friday about the ""public enemy"" statement. Are you saying that all of the press is the public enemy? People who didn't vote for the President? Just the people in this room, or -- is it just Bill Maher and maybe Warren Beatty? Can you clarify what we're talking about? MR. SPICER: I think the President made clear in his tweet that he was referring to the fake news and people who ascribe to pushing fake stories is where his target was. Q: Thanks a lot, Sean. As you know, more than 60 Democrats either boycotted or skipped the President's inauguration. What kind of reception do you think the President will get tomorrow evening from Democrats in the House and Senate when he gives his joint address? MR. SPICER: Well, I hope a very robust and applause-filled reception. The speech, as I mentioned, breaks down a lot of barriers that have traditionally been political barriers in terms of areas where I think we should find agreement that reaffirm the President's desire to unite the country and unite our parties in areas of shared common ground. And I think the things that he's talking about -- increasing the support to our military, our veterans; helping children get an education -- those are things that hopefully we can all come together and think are shared American values, regardless of party. I hope that we see a tremendous amount of support for the President and his policies and his vision tomorrow night. He recognizes the problems that our nation faces, but he also charts a vision forward. And I think it's one that if people are honest, that they will agree that it really isn't a political agenda as much as an agenda for this country and one to move us forward. So I think that we'll have to wait and see, but I can tell you that I think it will be a positive move forward. Zeke. Q: Thanks, Sean. Couple follow-ups to Olivier's question earlier about the ISIS review. It's day 30. The memorandum the President signed 30 days ago said that he was supposed to be briefed. Can you give us a more -- a timeline on when specifically President Trump will be involved -- I know you mentioned there's a principals meeting earlier today -- what the timeline of the review is? And then separately, you mentioned that Secretary Mattis was the one who's presenting it to the principals committee. The memorandum included things other than just the military; it included public diplomacy efforts to cut off financial ties to ISIS. What were the other Cabinet secretaries involved? What is sort of -- what got us here and where do we go from here? MR. SPICER: Thank you. Let me, if I may, get briefed on who and what occurred in the principals meeting to the extent that it's available, and I'd be glad to get back to you tomorrow on that. I just don't have that information available. Gabi. Q: Thanks, Sean. Palm Beach County has said that it's costing $60,000 a day in overtime pay every time the President comes to visit West Palm Beach. He's slated to go there again this weekend according to some reports. Is the President taking any steps to ensure that taxpayers aren't saddled with tremendous costs in his travel habits, considering he was so critical of his predecessor on that matter? MR. SPICER: Well, Gabi, the security for the President and the First Family is set by the Secret Service. As you know, they determine the security measures that need to be taken to protect the President -- frankly, any President. So I'm going to leave it up to the Secret Service to decide what security measures and steps are taken to protect the President. And, as you know, I mean, this -- depending on -- it transcends administrations. Wherever the President goes, they need to make sure that the President and the First Family is safe. That's something that I think -- we rely on the Secret Service to make those determinations. They continue to do a phenomenal job making sure that the First Family and the President and the Vice President are protected, and we have full confidence in the decisions that they make. So thank you guys very much. We'll have a briefing tomorrow -- later today on the state. Q: Approximate time? MR. SPICER: What's that? Q: Approximate time? MR. SPICER: I would look in the 6 o'clock hour.  Q: Here? MR. SPICER: Yes, here. Q: After 6:00? MR. SPICER: I get to see you here again. I would plan on around 6:00. We'll have further guidance. And I don't anticipate it being long. I think we're just going to walk through the -- off camera. We'll walk through the themes of the speech, take any questions, and then try to get some additional information, depending on where the President is in his read-through. Q: No briefing tomorrow, right? MR. SPICER: No briefing tomorrow. If you don't want one, you don't have to have one. Q: You said you'd get back to us on a couple of issues tomorrow. MR. SPICER: Well, I'm -- it's April that brought up no briefing. If you guys want to vote -- Q: No, no, no, but tradition is there's no briefing on -- that's why I'm asking. MR. SPICER: I know. We will do something for you, I promise. We will make sure we get back -- Q: Is it going to be a gaggle like last Friday, or is it going to be -- MR. SPICER: No, no, we will get back to you. I'm sure you'll see my face here tomorrow. Thank you very much. I'll see you guys tomorrow. END 2:46 P.M. EST"
Donald J. Trump: Press Gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders,2017-02-28,"3:07 P.M. EST MS. SANDERS: Good Afternoon. Sorry for the delay. Obviously, I never want to step on anything the President is doing, so I wanted to wait until he finished. The President has obviously got a full day and night planned, so I'm going to try to keep this short so that you guys can get focused on his speech coming up later. First off, and I know Sean briefly spoke about this yesterday -- and, by the way, just for clarification, he is not here, clearly, because he is up on the Hill briefing House and Senate communicators about the speech and previewing that for them right now. But Sean mentioned this yesterday, and I'm sure that it stuck with me, but the story has developed further. I wanted to address the tragic shooting in Kansas. The President is keeping the family of the victim, who was senselessly, killed in his thoughts, and we're praying for the full and speedy recovery of those who were wounded. As more facts come to light, and it begins to look like this was an act of racially-motivated hatred, we want to reiterate that the President condemns these and any other racially- or religiously-motivated attacks in the strongest terms. They have no place in our country, and we will continue to make that clear. In regards to the rest of the events today, this morning the Vice President swore in Secretary Ross as the Secretary of Commerce in his ceremonial office, and the President knows Secretary Ross is eager to get started building the country back up again, and we're glad to finally have him in place at the Commerce Department to do just that. Moving on to the President's day, this morning, after receiving his national daily intelligence briefing, the President met with the National Association of Attorneys General, and then had lunch with members of the press, as is tradition for the day of the joint address to Congress.  This afternoon, the President, as most of you saw, just signed two bills and executive orders. The first bill, H.R. 321, also known as the INSPIRE Act, encourages NASA to have women and girls participate in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and to pursue careers in aerospace using extreme programs and resources.  H.R. 255, or the Promoting Women and Entrepreneurship Act, is a similar bill targeted to the National Science Foundation. The bill encourages NSF to also use existing programs to recruit and support the employment of women in the sciences. These bills are the next step in the President's continued focus on empowering women of all ages and all interests to pursue their chosen careers.  As you saw, the President and Prime Minister Trudeau spent an afternoon speaking with female business leaders about the unique challenges facing women in the workplace earlier this month. And just last week, during his listening session with manufacturing CEOs, the President heard from a breakout group focused specifically on policies that could help lessen or remove some of those same barriers. The President also signed two executive orders. The first instructs the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to review and reconsider the Obama administration's Clean Water Rule, as well as providing instruction to the Attorney General for current legal action on the rule. The Obama administration's rule vastly expands federal jurisdiction into state and local areas, and the decisions that directly affects them, and that's something that this administration does not take lightly.  The second executive order will make Historically Black Colleges and Universities a priority again in the White House. This order provides a framework for repositioning the HBCU initiative in the White House, allowing it to function across all executive departments and agencies in consultation with the Department of Education. As you might have seen yesterday, the President welcomed the over 60 presidents of HBCUs and representatives from leading HBCU organizations to the Oval Office before their listening session with the Vice President and Secretary DeVos. The President is extremely committed to keeping the promises he made regarding HBCUs on the campaign trail, and looks forward to working with these leaders and organizations to provide HBCUs with the resources that they need. Later this afternoon, probably right about now, the President is meeting with the guests who will be seated with the First Lady at his first address to the Joint Congress. We provided a list and shorts bios of each of the guests via email last night. Now, I'm also able to confirm two additional guests for the First Lady: Jessica Gregory and her proud mother, Sheila Gregory. Jessica was diagnosed at birth with spina bifida, and has undergone 11 surgeries at Children's National Health System. Today, she is a dynamic 18-year-old honor student in Maryland, planning for college and a career as a public interest reporter, which was sparked by her experiences at Children's National Seacrest Studios. Later this evening, the President will proceed to the U.S. Capitol where he will address the Joint Session of Congress at 9:10 p.m. And, of course, I don't want to spoil anything, but it's safe to say that the President will be presenting a forward-looking vision to the American people. He's already proven that he can bring results and relief to this country, and a wave of optimism is surging across the country in response.  In terms of an outline of some of the policy areas the President will address during his speech, the President will specifically ask Congress to join him in coming up with and implementing solutions to restart the engine of our economy, provide more access to quality, affordable healthcare, expand educational opportunities to every child no matter their zip code, and unite with law enforcement and the military to protect our communities and our homeland. Together, with the help of Congress, state and local governments, the President will set our country back on the path to a bright future. Speaking of future, looking ahead in the schedule, I have some updates on the President's upcoming travel. On Thursday, he will travel to Virginia to give remarks aboard the USS Gerald Ford, and participate in a roundtable with military officials, shipbuilders, and community leaders. Initial guidance for that has already been sent out, and we'll have updates for credentialed media coming soon. On Friday, the President will attend a listening session on school choice at St. Andrews Catholic School in Florida, and we'll have guidance for that out soon. And with that, I'll take you questions. Phil. Q: Yeah, Sarah, thanks. Two things: First, can you -- MS. SANDERS: Of course, let's not mess with tradition here. Q: Very -- they're simple things. Can you confirm a discussion that happened with the network anchors about immigration, where apparently the President is now open to a compromise bill on immigration reform, and something he might include in the speech tonight?  And the second point is regarding the State Department budget. There are some reports out there about possibly a 37 or 38 percent cut to the State Department budget.  MS. SANDERS: So I'll start with the first question. I was not a participant in the lunch today, so not part of the specific conversation, so I can't speak to the exact conversation that took place. But I do know that the President has been very clear in his process that the immigration system is broken and needs massive reform, and he has made clear that he is open to having conversations about that and moving forward. Right now, his primary focus, as he had made over and over again, is border control and security at the border, and deporting criminals from our country, and keeping our country safe. And those priorities have not changed. Q: And the State Department? MS. SANDERS: And the State Department -- as we said before, I think -- not congressman anymore --- but OMB Director Mulvaney made it pretty clear that the budget priorities that we laid out were just that -- they were priorities. And right now, we're in a discussion process. This is the same historically today that it always works: We put out our priorities, we lay those out to the departments, they offer feedback to us, and so right now we're just in a discussion process. So there's nothing firm and exact on any numbers that may be coming out of that. Kristen. Q: Two subjects for you. Kansas -- you started off your remarks talking about it. Can we expect the President to address that tonight? And forgetting about what may or may not have been discussed, is the President open to an immigration bill that would include a pathway to citizenship without undocumented immigrants leaving the country? MS. SANDERS: On your first question, I wouldn't be surprised if that was mentioned in the speech tonight. In terms of the immigration, again, I haven't had further conversations with him about that today, but I do know that his priorities have been very clear on immigration, and that's the number one focus right now. Q: One follow on that. Is it safe to say he wouldn't -- MS. SANDERS: That's three now. Q: -- rule out -- it's a follow. It's a follow-up. MS. SANDERS: Just so you know, I'm not like Sean. I'm not going to let her set precedents and take three questions from everybody. Q: Very quick follow. Is it safe to say he wouldn't rule out the possibility of an immigration bill that would not deport people who don't have criminal records? In other words, is the focus still on those with criminal records? And is he very seriously considering some type to carve-out for those who don't have criminal records? MS. SANDERS: Again, the focus is certainly on those with a criminal background and criminal record. But until I've had a chance to have a conversation with the President, I'm not going to speak to that any further. Sure, go ahead. Q: Thank you. Two questions, of course. First off, the budget and possible reductions to the State Department. Would that indicate -- would those reductions indicate any desire to run foreign policy more directly out of the White House as opposed to through the State Department and career diplomats?  MS. SANDERS: I'm sorry, I'm not following what you're asking here. Q: Cuts to the State Department. There have been reports saying that Secretary Tillerson has been sort of marginalized in a lot of foreign policy discussions going on. And do these cuts indicate any desire to run foreign policy more directly from the White House and not through the State Department? MS. SANDERS: Well, I would disagree that Secretary Tillerson has been marginalized. I think nothing could be further from the truth. And so I wouldn't rely on sources outside of the White House in terms of who will be making decisions. And at this point, the Secretary of State is very much empowered to do that. Nothing has changed on that front. Q: Second question. MS. SANDERS: Go ahead. Q: Not to belabor a point, but to follow up on Kristen's question. The reports that are out there are still coming in about this conversation that was had today, but is it fair then to say that the President supports at least a compromise immigration bill? And then just give us a few details on how he's spending the afternoon in terms of this speech. Like, is it done? Is he still tweaking? Things like that. MS. SANDERS: I love that if we keep asking the same question we think we might get a different answer. I know. I appreciate the effort; I think you guys get As for effort. But again, I'm going to continue to say: Until I've had a chance to have that conversation with the President, I'm not going to speculate on what that would look like.  In terms of the afternoon, I know right now he is currently meeting with the people that will be seated with the First Lady. And this afternoon, he has plans to work through the speech and practice and make any last-minute changes to that.  Go ahead. Q: So those people that he's meeting with right now, is he going to be directly referencing them in his speech tonight? MS. SANDERS: I think you can rest assured that most of those names will come up in the speech tonight. Q: And any idea when the excerpts will be coming out? MS. SANDERS: I think we may have some later this afternoon. I don't know that we'll have the full text of the speech before, but I do believe we'll have at least some nuggets of the speech that we will release later today. Shaileagh (ph).  Q: Thank you. So first, on the JCC threats, apparently Pennsylvania Attorney General Shapiro is saying that in part of his conversation with the President, the President indicated that these threats may have come from ""the reverse"" or ""to make others look bad."" Do you dispute that characterization of -- what did the President mean by that? Was he saying that these anti-Semitic threats are coming from -- I don't know, you tell us. MS. SANDERS: Look, I wasn't part of a private conversation. What I do know is the conversations that I have had with the President, he's been extremely clear and extremely consistent on this topic. Any act of violence towards people of the Jewish faith is condemned by this administration. Full stop. Q: And then one on healthcare, as well. There have been -- some Republicans have now come out publicly against the draft plan that is being circulated in Congress on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. Is the President concerned about the fact that more conservatives are now saying they couldn't support that plan? And what is his message to those Republicans? MS. SANDERS: Not at all, because the draft plan is exactly that -- a draft. It's meant to open up the conversation. The last several days the President has spent time with governors, he's meeting with attorney generals, he's met with CEOs of major healthcare companies to talk about how they can improve that plan. The big things that he's made a priority is that we will repeal Obamacare but replace it with something better. And that's a lot of what these conversations that he's had over the last several days are helping to do, is to make that plan better. And the one that's been floated out there is nothing more than a draft. April. Q: Sarah -- and I want to ask two questions on two different things. When it comes to inclusion, what is the President talking about tonight when it's inclusion? Is it about race? Is it about politics? What does this inclusion vision or unity vision include? MS. SANDERS: I think it's very clear, the President has made no secret from the campaign trail through the first month in office that his priority is putting Americans first. And when he says ""Americans,"" he means all Americans. He's not specifying breaking it out by demographic. He's talking about every single American, and I don't think you can be any more clear when it comes to unity than that -- and inclusion. Q: And last question, on HBCUs. There's no new money in it, but the people who came to the stakeout, who were in the room for the signing, were talking about a promise of more money. They've been looking forward to more money from (inaudible) Commerce. What is this next step for them, I guess, to do when it comes to getting more money and this promise beyond what you're already doing trying to bring the agencies together to pinpoint things (inaudible)? What is this promise of hope for money? MS. SANDERS: I'm not sure on the specific resources, but I do know that the President's priority here is making sure that the HBCUs have a direct line within the White House and not layers of bureaucracy to have to go through. And so that conversation has opened up so that he can be part of that directly. And that's a big part of moving this group back into the White House outside of the Department of Education. Q: So you don't know anything else about -- MS. SANDERS: I do know that there have been a lot of different discussions on how that could happen. Some of that is through -- all of the different departments have -- there are quite a few departments -- you would be surprised, not just Department of Education, that actually have funding streams for HBCUs, and figuring out how best to streamline that so that more money goes back to the actual colleges and universities. Jennifer. Q: The Pentagon -- that 30-day report yesterday on defeating ISIS. Can you give us any sort of update on the options presented in that and what the President's reaction was? MS. SANDERS: I think the President has been very clear, he never lays out a strategy to defeat an enemy. And that's exactly what he was asked to get back was a strategy and options. And I know that that was presented yesterday. Jim. Q: Did the White House reach out to the Pentagon to see what kind of information could be made public about what intelligence was gathered in that Yemen raid? Do you know if that's something that occurred? MS. SANDERS: I know we've had conversations with people at DOD. I haven't been given specifics, but I do know that very clearly it was stated that there was substantial information gathered that was offered. And I'm trying to figure -- remember exactly how they phrased it -- but actionable items within that information. Sure, go ahead. Q: Just to follow up on immigration, I know you said the focus is still on border security and deporting criminals. But can we expect the President to actually talk about a call for a broader immigration bill at all in the speech? Or is that just something you're saying he's open to but we're not going to hear about it tonight? MS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to get in front of the President's speech tonight, but I do think that you can expect immigration to be mentioned. But I'll let him fill you in on the details of what that actually looks like. Q: Two questions. So first, with regard to the anti-ISIS plan, how much of that can we expect to hear from him tonight? You're saying that he doesn't want to kind of reveal the game plan, but it could involve boosting troop numbers perhaps. I mean, the American people probably would want to know something like that. So is there anything that's going to hint to that? The second part is, General McMaster has been reported to say that he didn't think that the phrase ""radical Islamic extremism"" is helpful, is a useful term. So is the President going to try to kind of tone that down in his speech tonight? Or can we expect to still hear that kind of language used? MS. SANDERS: I know that national security will be a big part of the speech tonight. And again, I don't want to get ahead of that, but I think you can certainly anticipate him addressing national security in depth tonight. Zeke. Q: Thanks, Sarah. A follow-up question about the ISIS review. Sean yesterday promised a -- I guess more information today on the process, who was involved in drafting this review -- not specifics of what was in it. And yesterday, the principals committee, when as it actually brought the President? That's the first one.  The second one is, you've spent a lot of time talking about (inaudible) following up on a question earlier. Does the administration hope that the State Department keeps the special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism? Or will the White House sort of commit to keeping that position?  MS. SANDERS: Yeah, on the first question in terms of the plan and the specifics, luckily we're not all the way through with today. And it's going to be a long day, so we've still got plenty of time to get that information to you. In terms of the second part, I'm not clear on the plan for that, but we'll check and get back to you on it. Q: Just two small, short questions. Do you have anything on this immigration -- about the skilled laborers? For example, H-1B visa. Because there is a group of lawmakers who were in Delhi, and they spoke to Prime Minister Modi who gave -- there is a lot of fear about the H-1B visa being slashed. So do you have anything on that? MS. SANDERS: I don't have any announcements on that right now. Q: And the Indian foreign secretary is in town from today until March 4th. Any meetings scheduled here?  MS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of right now, but I'll check and we'll get back to you and let you know for sure. Q: Sarah, I was wondering if you have any details on the strike that may have killed Abu al-Khayr al-Masri, the al Qaeda number two? MS. SANDERS: I don't have any comments at all. Not at this time. John Gizzi. Q: Thank you, Sarah. Two brief questions for you. One, in at least two of the televised debates during the Republican presidential nomination, candidate Trump made it clear he was for abolishing the Department of Education. Now he is President, and are there going to be major cutbacks in the Department of Education that have been approved by Secretary DeVos? MS. SANDERS: I'm not sure about specific cutbacks. But I do know that there is a heavy emphasis and priority on moving power away from the federal government to the state and local government. And I know that that was one of the topics that was discussed yesterday with a lot of the governors that were in town. Specifically that topic came up. And I think you can look for ways that we'll start moving power from the federal government to state and local governments where they're closer to education decisions. But as far as specific plans, I couldn't speak to that today. Q: So it's phasing out the department rather than abolishing? MS. SANDERS: I did not say that we were phasing out the department. I said we were moving power away from the federal government to state and local governments. But as far as specifics go, I'm sure we'll be getting to those over the next couple of months. Q: My other question is --  MS. SANDERS: Sean set me up for the take two here. (Laughter.)  Q: The Islamic Resistance Council, one of the best-known groups in opposition to the government in Tehran, recently released documents saying the Quds Force, the Elite Revolutionary Guards in Iran have an extra-territorial division now that is fomenting violence in other countries, including Yemen, Iraq, and Syria. Is the administration aware of this? And does it have any comment on it? MS. SANDERS: That's a question I would refer to the NSC, instead of through us.  Q: In his Fox interview, the President said this morning, ""We will be putting out a replacement plan for Obamacare."" Who is ""we""? MS. SANDERS: Well, I think it's no secret he's been spending a lot of time working with members of Congress, his HHS Secretary, Secretary Price, himself. And again, he's had countless meetings over the first few weeks in office with a lot of people that have major influence and major impact, and that a repeal-and-replace plan would impact a lot. So I think it's a collective thing. But primarily the President, the Department of HHS, and Congress. Q: Will that be one plan? Or is it going to be a White House plan and a congressional plan?  MS. SANDERS: I don't think we're ready to make that full announcement today, but I definitely know that it's a collective process that we've been working through. Jim. Q: Just to follow up on that question: Has there been some warmth shown to the Speaker's office and to the House Republican proposal? That's what we're hearing from sources up on the Hill, that they're feeling a little bit better about the way the President is receiving their proposals for repealing and replacing Obamacare. MS. SANDERS: Look, we -- absolutely, this President is very clear he wants to work with Congress. And we want to make sure that we have the best plan possible. And I think that requires that all of us come together and work together to make sure we get that. And that's exactly what we've been doing. Q: Can I just follow on that, Sarah? There are a variety of House Republicans who know that the working draft is dead in the House -- among Republicans for ACA repeal and replace. And their question is whether they're going to hear from the President something more specific that will help give them cover and lead them forward on ACA, publicly. So my question to you is: What is he going to say that might be in the vein that they're talking about -- leading, giving them cover, and describing something in more detail than Obamacare needs to be repealed and replaced?  MS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to get ahead of the President's speech tonight. But I do know that he will address Obamacare. He'll talk about some of his priorities for the plan, and I'll let him speak to that later this evening. Q: Can I also ask -- Sean said yesterday we could expect a new immigration, travel EO by midweek. Is that still operable? MS. SANDERS: I would say that's pretty likely.  Francesca. Q: Thank you, Sarah. The White House, I'm wondering, if you have a strategy for who is sitting with the President -- or rather with the First Lady in the box -- for instance, Democrats are purposefully bringing DREAMers, they're purposefully brining Muslims to show their opposition to some of the President's strategy. So what is the White House's message with the people that are sitting in the President's box? MS. SANDERS: I think the primary reason that a lot of times you have people in the box are they're -- that highlight specific parts of the speech and specific parts of the agenda. And I think you can see the people sitting with him. It's pretty obvious the reason that most of them are there. And he's laid out those priorities since day one of his administration. And so I think it's pretty self-explanatory there, Francesca. Jordan. Q: Thanks, Sarah. The President's budget -- even though it's not complete yet -- has already been running into some significant resistance among Senate Republicans. Senator McConnell is out there criticizing the State Department cuts. Senator Graham said it was dead on arrival. So I just want to know what the White House is doing to talk to these members, maybe assuage their concerns. Can you give us a picture what's going on behind the scenes to get support for that document before it comes out? MS. SANDERS: Sure. I mean, the President met with Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell earlier this week to talk about some of those priorities. But again, this isn't a final budget. It's a draft, and the whole point of it is to receive feedback, work together, and put the best budget forward possible. And that's exactly what process we're in right now. Director Mulvaney is focused on doing that. And I know he's got a lot of colleagues in the House and Senate, and he'll be speaking with a lot of those people over the coming weeks as we lead up to rolling out our budget.  Q: Sarah, the President said he believes that former President Barack Obama is secretly behind these waves of protests that have been coming up these last few weeks. What tangible evidence is President Trump basing this on? And when was the last time the two spoke? MS. SANDERS: I'll let the President's comments on that stand for itself. And I'm not sure on the last time they spoke. I'd have to check on that and get back to you. Q: But does the White House believe that President Obama and his people -- like the President is suggesting -- are behind these protests? MS. SANDERS: Look, I think the bottom line here is that we've all condemned the protests. I think that that's the bigger story here. And the focus that we should be talking about is that this isn't something that helps and moves us forward. And that's what we're focused on right now. Q: Two questions -- one is on immigration.  MS. SANDERS: The topic of the day. Q: In 2014, President Trump, then-citizen Trump, spoke to CPAC and said that he thought immigration in the long term, if there was an immigration reform bill, that it would be a loser for the Republican Party; that the people who could be naturalized through the process would only vote for Democrats. Has the President come to a different political calculation that if there is a pathway to citizenship for people here illegally, that they could eventually vote for Republicans? MS. SANDERS: Again, I haven't had the chance to talk with the President about this specific policy that we've now asked about multiple times. But we'll try to do that and get something to you guys in the next --  Q: Does the President think that human exploration is something that is important for the -- human space exploration is something that's important for the country to invest in, in the future? MS. SANDERS: I'm not sure if I would say that it's a top priority. But I know it's something that's certainly been discussed. Thanks, guys. We look forward to the speech tonight, and we'll get you some more details. Q: (Inaudible) tonight? Hopefully we'll have some more information to lay out for you guys later this afternoon. Thanks. END 3:33 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-03-01,"11:40 A.M. EST MR. SPICER: Hi, guys. I'm going to try to keep this relatively short. We got a few things going on today, and I know that the pool has got to get out to do a spray at some point soon with the lunch.  So, obviously, last night was a big night for the President and for everyone here at the White House. The President delivered a powerful statement to Congress, to Americans, and the world last night. It was an optimistic, forward-looking message of unity, strength, straight from his heart. The President was proud to stand before the American people last night and present his roadmap for a renewal of the American spirit. He honestly and -- he honestly acknowledged the undeniable challenges that we face, but continually reminded us there's no challenge facing this country that we can't meet if we join together. The American spirit has already proven itself against seemingly insurmountable odds, and we'll do it again under the leadership of this President. Republicans and Democrats may be divided on policies, but we're also united in our mission to achieve peace and prosperity for every American citizen. The President has obviously been humbled by the great reception that the -- the reception that his address received. Today, the President is holding a series of meetings with White House staff, congressional leaders, and others to drive the goals that he laid out last night. He'll host shortly a leadership lunch with House and Senate Republican leadership. The attendees will include the Vice President, Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, Senator Cornyn, Leader McCarthy, Congressman Scalise, Senator Gardiner and Senator Perdue. Last night's address clearly generated a lot of momentum, and the President is anxious to continue working on an ambitious legislative agenda. During his speech last night, the President mentioned policies in key areas, from urban renewal to trade reform, where too many leading agencies and departments in charge of implementing are still waiting on their confirmed leaders.  The President was pleased, obviously, to see that Ryan Zinke was confirmed as the Secretary of the Interior by the Senate just a short time ago. So the confirmation process is now coming to an end for him, and start to get the work going.  As the President mentioned in last night's remarks -- and, by the way, one quick note, we'll have an update on his swearing-in hopefully soon. As the President mentioned in last night's remarks, he's calling on Congress to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a patient-focused system that expands options, lowers costs, and improves healthcare outcomes for all Americans. He's ready to restart the honest engine -- to restart the engine of the American economy, which means tax reform that brings down rates for the middle class and simplifies the tax code, a robust infrastructure program and a budget that puts the interests of American people first.  The President and congressional leaders will work together today to continue to chart a path forward on those issues and more. Also, today, Judge Neil Gorsuch will be back up on the Hill meeting with seven senators, including Senators Booker, Sanders, Barrasso and Kaine. And lastly, this evening, the President will have dinner with Secretary Tillerson. Looking ahead, I know Sarah was kind enough to come brief you yesterday about the President's trip to Hampton Roads tomorrow. I'll have a few more details for you on that. The President is looking forward to meeting with the members of the Navy and some of the sailors down there, the shipbuilders, including the lead shipbuilder of the USS Gerald Ford and the ship's commander, before giving remarks on deck to a group of shipbuilders and sailors. On Friday, the President will be in Orlando, Florida for a series of important events highlighting his educational agenda. He'll be visiting St. Andrews Catholic School, where I think you can expect him to drop in on a few lucky classrooms, as well as meeting with parents, teachers, and administrators. Education, as was noted last night from the President, is a top priority. He has said many times before that education has the ability to level the playing field for the next generation. Obviously, last night he noted that he believes this is the civil rights issue of this generation. He is determined to provide choice for every parent, and opportunities for every child, regardless of their zip code. I expect he will be speaking with the parents and teachers and administrators at St. Andrews on his upcoming plans for reaching that goal. And finally, I want to note that the President is monitoring the situation in the Midwest, where a string of tornadoes is devastating several states with more severe weather predicted for the coming states -- for the coming days. Three lives have already been tragically cut short. The families of those victims and also those who have had their homes and property destroyed are in the President's thoughts and prayers. The millions of people in the path of severe weather will be at the top of his mind over the next few days. He implores everyone to follow the directions of emergency services and stay inside, and obviously will continue to be in contact with state and local officials to provide the necessary federal support that is required. With that, I'm glad to take some questions. Q: On the lunch today, was it always -- MR. SPICER: John Roberts. (Laughter.)  Q: -- was it always just going to be Republican leadership? Were the Democrats ever invited? Will he meet with the Democrats? MR. SPICER: Yeah, I'm sure he will. And you've seen he's met with a bipartisan group of Senate leaders last week. He met with a bipartisan group of attorney general yesterday. He met with the bipartisan group of governors. I mean, just to be factual here, at some point, the people who set the agenda and the timetable to enact his agenda are Republican, and so there's a difference between meeting with both sides of the aisle, and I think he has pretty well shown a desire to reach across the aisle in the last month. But this is about actually charting out the agenda and the timeline, and that's why it's both groups. But yeah, I think you'll continue to see not just -- in the next week, not just leadership but rank-and-file members of the House and the Senate with that aim. Q: Sean, the Dow Jones crossed 21,000 for the first time today. MR. SPICER: It did. Q: Does the White House believe that that's a reaction to the President's speech last night? MR. SPICER: (Laughter.) Look, I'm not an economist. I don't want to -- I know the Dow goes up and down, as well as the other indexes, and I don't want to get in the habit of commenting every time the Dow hits. But I think that you've seen a sustained economic boon since the President was elected. He commented on it last night.  I think you're seeing not just the Dow react, but manufacturers, business leaders, folks from small and large companies talk about it. And I think that there is a renewed sense of wanting to business, and of economic growth and optimism. You've seen it in not just in the indexes on a day-to-day basis as they go up and down, but also in the confidence numbers that show that there is a continued growth in the confidence in our economy and our market and our policies.  Look, I don't want to tie a direct link. I think that that's -- you know, we could go back and forth every day about where the market stands at any given time in a day. But I would have to believe that when you talk to a lot of economists, they -- and frankly, not just the economists who look at it academically and try to parse it, but when you talk to these company CEOs and leaders that he's talking to, there is a renewed sense of confidence in their country, in the agenda, in the desire to hire and grow and expand in the United States, and I can only see that as a positive sign, not just for the market, but for our entire economy. Q: How long -- to follow up on that -- how long does the President think he can wait in order to provide specifics on tax reform and Obamacare and the others before we start to lose that sense of momentum and confidence that you're talking about in the markets? MR. SPICER: Well, I think it's not just those pieces. Obviously, it's bigger than just that. But I think that, with respect to Obamacare, he's talked about the next few weeks having something out there, and then same with tax reform. And I think both of those things that we'll be working with the Hill. Secretary Mnuchin mentioned the other day that hopefully having a tax plan done by (inaudible). But both of those, specifically, are massive undertakings. And the idea that they are going to be done in two seconds is a little bit of a fallacy, and I think that we've given folks updates and guidelines as far as when we see this thing moving. And I think that that's a pretty good guide of where we go. Jim Stinson. Q: Sean, Governor Beshear said on Morning Joe today -- I'm paraphrasing -- that people are going to die if GOP healthcare plans more forward. What does the administration say to Democrats suggesting Obamacare repeal will cost American lives? MR. SPICER: Well, I would suggest to the former governor that, when you look at where Obamacare stands right now -- I think I've mentioned this before, Jim -- but more and more people are facing higher and higher premiums. People are choosing to opt out of the exchange and pay the penalty. It is collapsing on its own. And I don't -- I think that that's a bit extreme. The reality is that more people are having problems right now. They're losing their doctor. They're losing the plan that they liked. I'd like him to defend -- I mean, I read to you guys two days ago Nancy Pelosi's own definition of success for Obamacare. They had three prongs for that, and they failed on all three of them. So Governor Beshear -- you know, the President last night extended an olive branch to Democrats and Republicans to work with him on a plan that actually achieves the goals that were laid out. That's what he should -- if he wants to be focused, it's not just former governors, but I think current governors were here to talk about what they want. And so I know Governor Bevin, the current governor of Kentucky, has noted the concerns that Obamacare has in Kentucky now. And I think those are the challenges and problems that the President is seeking to fix on this. The reality is, is that we have to have a healthcare system that Americans can afford, that give them choice, that have doctors that can deal with the problems they have. And that's what we're working with Congress on right now is to get that kind of a plan in place. John Gizzi. Q: Thank you, Sean. One brief question. MR. SPICER: Wow. (Laughter.) Q: Senator Schumer, the Minority Leader, has said that the President is stalling on one of the pivotal points of his agenda -- infrastructure -- where he could work with Democrats. What's the administration's response to Senator Schumer? MR. SPICER: Well, I think first and foremost, I'm glad to see that he has finally found one area that he's willing to work with the President on. I know that multiple times this morning he was offered an opportunity on various shows to talk about things that he thought they could work with on the -- with the President. And I think it took -- in particular, I saw the exchange on NBC and it was somewhat disappointing that when you look at all the things that the President said that I think offered an olive branch to both parties and seemingly should unify the country on issues and on goals, that it's nice to finally hear that we found one. Because I think there were a lot of areas in that speech last night that transcended party lines and ideology, and that united us all as Americans. With respect to infrastructure, I think the President noted last night that we're going to continue to see a plan evolve that's really structured in a private partner financing mechanism that will continue to move forward. But whether it's our roads or bridges, our airports, air traffic control, there is an infrastructure piece of our nation that is so vital to the way we do life. And not just that, but -- not just the building itself and the construction of it, but those roads are what -- are the byway and the pathway to so much of our economic commerce today. And doing them not only is good for the jobs that they will create on the projects, but allowing us to have -- allowing products to get to market and consumers to get to business, et cetera, is actually a magnifying event for that. Q: Sean, I'm just looking for some clarification on your comments from the last week about the administration's stance on recreational marijuana. During the campaign, the President had said that this is a states' rights issue. Is this still where he believes this issue should flow, or does he believe it's a federal --  MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think, Trey, there is a specific carve-out in the appropriations for medical marijuana. And I think the President understands that that can be a vital part of treatment, especially for terminally ill patients and people facing certain kinds of medical things. But there is a -- I think I was very -- I'm sorry if I wasn't, but I think I was clear that there is a big difference between the medical and the non-medical. Margaret. Q: Sean, two things on the speech. The President talked about robust engagement when he was talking about foreign policy. But at the same time, the White House is talking about cutting foreign aid by a large amount. How do you track those two things? MR. SPICER: Well, because you can have engagement -- I mean, I don't know that --  Q: Like, who is going to be doing the diplomacy if you're cutting the State Department funding? MR. SPICER: I mean, who is going to be doing it? There's people that do --  Q: Who is the lead on foreign policy? Is it the White House or the State Department?  MR. SPICER: Secretary of State. Q: It is the Secretary of State? MR. SPICER: Of course, it is. I mean, look, the President obviously guides our foreign policy in terms of who implements it, whether it's -- if you talk about healthcare, it's going to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services. If it's on trade, it's going to be the USTR. I mean, so it's pretty clear that the Secretary of State implements the President's foreign policy agenda. Q: Right, but more robust versus cutting. They sound contradictory --  MR. SPICER: But, again, I think this is a very Washington trap. Just because dollars do not decide engagement -- I think one of the things that's fascinating is that as the President has talked to all of these foreign leaders -- I don't know in a single case -- and, again, I can't say I've been on every call -- but I can't think of -- maybe one or two or something, because again, I don't want to get in a trap of trying to -- but I cannot say in most cases, at least, that I've heard direct aid being a discussion that has come up. In fact, what I hear more often is: ""Gosh, we haven't heard from the United States in a long time. We haven't had you engage in issues of concern with us. We haven't talked about trade. We haven't talked about other issues of bilateral concern."" I think that's what a robust, healthy, bilateral relationship with a country is about. I think it is a very Washington-centered argument to literally tie dollars to any program or any type of engagement -- to say something is robust by the dollar figure is something that is a very Washington answer. But I think that you can look at dollars that have gotten to a lot of countries. And when we ask them, what's your relationship been with the United States? They'll say, we haven't had much engagement at all with the United States in a while. Anita. Q: Sorry, I had a second question --  MR. SPICER: John tried to start something; it just didn't continue. (Laughter.)  Q: In the speech last night, while the President talked about support for vets and support for military, he didn't talk about the 9,000 troops in Afghanistan, the 5,000 in Iraq, the hundreds of operators on the ground in Syria. Was there a reason that he didn't lay out his vision for foreign policy in those active war zones? MR. SPICER: Well, again, I think you could probably go through and say, he also didn't talk about this or that. He talked about his -- Q: The world is watching, and those are clear -- MR. SPICER: I understand that. But you can go through a lot of hotspots that we have in a country. I think when it comes to the military itself, he was very clear about his commitment to the military, his desire to fund the military, give them the infrastructure that it needs. It's why he's going to go to Hampton Roads tomorrow to talk about the investment that needs to get made. He talked about veterans and caring for the folks.  So I understand your question. But I think at some point you can literally go through all of the other areas that may not have come up on domestic and foreign policy, other nations that didn't get a mention, or a hotspot that didn't get up.  But I think in terms of his commitment to the country, his commitment to defeating ISIS, he did bring that up. He talked about the plan that he wants to have, the engagement that he's having with the Joint Chiefs in the military, the funding that he wants to lend them.  So I get that you can parse out something and say, ""but he didn't bring up this exact thing."" There's a lot of things that may or may not have come up last night, and that doesn't necessarily mean he didn't have the commitment to it. Q: He wasn't deemphasizing foreign policy? MR. SPICER: No, I think he talked about ISIS. He talked about the military. He talked about it. So I don't have -- Anita. Q: It will not surprise you that I have two questions. The first one is quick.  MR. SPICER: I think for Lent everyone needs to give up two questions. (Laughter.) Or maybe I could at least give up answering two questions. (Laughter.)  Q: I'll make the first one quick, so how about that? Can you update us on where we are on the executive order regarding vetting? MR. SPICER: Yeah, as I said, we would have an announcement at some point scheduling-wise. When we have one, we'll announce it. I think the President, as I mentioned a couple days ago, the issue for us has been a continued desire to share with the departments and agencies the ability to implement this, and we continue to do that. When we have a schedule to announce -- Q: When do you think --  MR. SPICER: I've not -- I've learned not to put days on things, because until we announce it, it's much like we've talked about all the executive orders, with all the personnel announcements. When the President is ready to make a decision, he lets us know and we let you know. So we're not there yet. Q: The second question -- can you tell us a little bit about the back story with Carryn Owens being there yesterday? She wasn't on the list you all sent out. When did the President talk to her? When did that happen? When was she invited? Why wasn't she on the official list? And did they have a chance to visit beforehand? MR. SPICER: Okay, I'll take these in order. She was invited on January 30th. In the condolence call to her, the President invited her and her three children to the White House. And during that call, said, ""You know, by the way, I'm going to be giving this speech in February. If you would feel comfortable, I would love to have you as a guest."" He asked if she'd like to bring the kids at that time. It was obviously a very raw and emotional time for her, and she said that's -- she appreciated the invitation, she would love to take him up on it, would get back to us. The President asked the military aide in the room at the time to follow up with her. She accepted the invitation. So she and her three children came to the White House yesterday, met with the President prior to the speech, and they had a time to visit before and then after, obviously.  Why she wasn't on the guidance: We had a conversation with her prior, and just said, you know, I know this is an emotional time for you. Respectfully to you guys, we knew that if we had released her name, that there would be a lot of media attention to her and her family. And we spoke to her before we put out the guest guidance and just said, would you rather us wait and hold? So we made a decision at the time that this was a very raw and emotional time for her, and we didn't -- we worked with her to decide what would be in her best interest and her family's best interest at this time.  Q: Were the children there? MR. SPICER: No, they were not there. Q: But her parents were there, correct? MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: But the children were in town -- MR. SPICER: The children were in town. They visited the White House. They had an opportunity to visit the Navy Mess, have lunch, go up and see -- and so the President got to see them. And they got a tour of the White House. Q: Was there some special interaction with Ivanka, because she was sitting next to her? Or it just happened to be where she sat? MR. SPICER: They met obviously over -- and obviously after -- at the end of the evening, the President brought them into the room where he was holding, and everybody, including the First Lady, had a chance to talk to her and her family, and mother and father. But, as I said, this was something that was extended -- the invitation was extended to her on the 30th of January when the President made that first call to her.  And again, just respectfully in terms of the follow-up, I know there's been a lot of interest in her, in Carryn. And we have -- our goal was to make sure that we respected her wishes and her privacy. And again, even with referencing her in the speech, that was her decision. We asked her -- the President would like to raise this. And she said, I'd like that. And so that was coordinated with her in terms of how public she wanted to be and how acknowledged she wanted her and Ryan to be as well.  Q: I just thought I'd bring this up so you could respond to it. You must have seen the criticism of her being there and the President mentioning her. And people are saying it's a photo-op. So since you're talking about it, do you want to respond to that, that it's a way to -- MR. SPICER: I think that that's -- I mean, again, he invited her on January 30th and extended an invitation. I don't -- it was she who accepted the invitation. I think she has a right to honor the legacy and sacrifice of her husband. And I think -- I've been in this town 25 years, probably watched State of the Unions for 30 -- which doesn't say a lot -- (laughter) -- for my viewing habits -- but I've never seen a sustained applause like that. And I think that you can say what you want about a lot of the policies, but I hope to God that everybody in America could literally say that that's the country that we live in, that you honor and support, not just Ryan's sacrifice, but her -- what she's going to go through and what those children are going to go through.  It was amazing -- I got a chance to talk to the kids yesterday and see them so -- you know, they're kids, they were happy, they were running around. I don't know that they fully appreciate the sacrifice that their father has made. But I just -- I'm not going to -- if that's the criticism that people that, they have a right to in this country. But I would also suggest that we have the right to honor the people who have served this nation and the sacrifice that the families make of those who serve. Q: Thanks, Sean. There were some quotes floating around last night from anonymous administration officials saying -- MR. SPICER: What? (Laughter.)  Q: What a surprise, right? (Laughter.) That part of the reason for the postponement of the announcement of the new travel ban was the positive reception of the speech, and that the administration wants the new executive order to ""have its own moment."" Was the speech perception part of the reason -- MR. SPICER: I will just refer you back to what I said to Anita's first question. We hadn't made an announcement. And I think that -- again, this gets back to personnel announcements, executive order announcements, other things. Until they're on the schedule, that doesn't make them official. And that's the point of making the announcement, is that we say this is where we're going and this is what we're doing. We try to provide you guys guidance. Obviously, there's a reason that we don't -- because sometimes things aren't ready, sometimes we want to make -- the President hasn't made up his final mind about executing something, or he wants to add something in. It's the same thing with the speech yesterday. I mean, we worked up until game time because the President wanted to continue to work on it.  But when we have announcements to make, we'll make them. Until we do, then it's not final.  Mara. Q: Thank you. I have two really short questions. The first one on the travel ban. The first request was for 90 days so that you could develop the new vetting regime. Thirty days have passed. I assume that means you're 30 days into this process. Does that mean that the next travel ban will ask for just the remaining time of the 90 days? MR. SPICER: Respectfully, I'm not -- this goes back to the last couple. I'm not going to start getting into discussions of an executive order that hasn't been announced yet. So to start talking about the specifics of something that I'm not even going to talk about the schedule of -- I'll give you credit for the try. Q: Okay, that's fair. My next question is on taxes. He talked about massive tax cuts for the middle class. Your Treasury Secretary at one point said there would be no absolute cut for the wealthy. What does that mean? MR. SPICER: It means that I think the focus is on the middle class. I think there's two things that are going to be highlighted in the tax reform. One is to make our companies and corporations and businesses more competitive so that they stay in this country and hire more people. I mean, that's --  Q: Right, I'm talking individuals. MR. SPICER: I know, I know. But what I'm saying is that there's two big components are going to drive tax reform -- that being one to help companies hire more people. And then two is the focus on the individual side of the ledger is going to be on middle-income tax relief. And so I think that's what Secretary Mnuchin was referring to. Q: But are you saying that a wealthy person will not get a larger -- in terms of percentage -- tax cut than a middle-class person? I mean, is that how you're measuring it? MR. SPICER: Again, all I'm going to do is stick at the high level now and say that the principle that's guiding this is middle-class tax relief. So I'm not going to get into deciding all this yet. Q: Thanks a lot, Sean. A lot has been made about the President's tone, his demeanor last night in his address to Congress in the sense that some people are describing it as very presidential; we haven't seen this side of President Trump in the early days of his presidency. Was this a one-off? Is this something we can expect from the President more often? For instance, tomorrow he is traveling down to the Newport News, Virginia area. Will we see the President Trump that we saw last night in his address to Congress, or more like the campaign-style rally that we saw down in Florida, which took place a few weeks ago? MR. SPICER: I think the Vice President said it best this morning. I mean, this is the President Trump, the candidate Trump, the President-elect Trump that I've known. And I think sometimes -- so I respectfully disagree in the sense that I think that the folks around him who have known him, who have gotten to know him, this is something that you see on a regular basis. And I think we're going to continue to see this.  I think more and more -- one of the programs this morning noted that people who have been around him for a long time, this is who he is. I think he's talked about this a lot, and I know sometimes you pull random clips, but this is who he is. And I don't necessarily subscribe to are we going to see more or less of this. He cares about this country, he's got a big heart, he wants America to succeed, he wants America to be safe, he wants more Americans to get back to work. And I think you're going to hear him talk about that over and over again. Blake. Q: Sean, the trade document that's out there, which suggests that the administration may take a position that would potentially ignore or look past WTO rulings. Is there any truth to this?  MR. SPICER: No. Q: What is the position? MR. SPICER: Again, I would just argue, look, we're a member of the WTO, we don't have a USTR in place yet. So to suggest that we're going to take any kind of trade policies -- I think, obviously, we've got some concerns with the percentage of dispute resolutions that are brought to the WTO versus other nations. But I would just -- that's sort of a fact in terms of the percentage of cases that get brought to dispute resolution at the USTR -- or, excuse me, at the WTO against the United States. But we don't have a U.S. Trade Representative, so I would say that that's not --  Q: Like a working -- MR. SPICER: No, no, no. I mean, it's not even a working. That's not -- full stop -- that is not our policy and that's not where we're going. Yes. Q: Sean, this is a follow-up on the -- from the heart. Was the President's softening of his immigration stand one from the heart or one from the political handbook? Let's put it that way. And did you get ashes this morning? MR. SPICER: Well, as soon as -- I mean, not that I'm a big fan of sharing, but I will be going to get my ashes later in a little bit. So -- Q: (Inaudible.)  MR. SPICER: I appreciate that. I will (inaudible) in mass, and I'll let my mom know that you appreciate that, and my parish priest. (Laughter.)  Q: -- might be able to see you --  MR. SPICER: I try to keep a little bit of the church and state out of this. Q: Do you have a confession? MR. SPICER: Huh? Q: Do you a have a confession while you're up there? (Laughter.)  MR. SPICER: There's three parts to Lent: alms giving, penance, and prayer. And I will make sure that I spend all 40 -- Q: Can you answer the first part of the question? MR. SPICER: No, I'm good with -- I'm sorry I got lost in my faith. (Laughter.)  Q: The President's softening -- MR. SPICER: Yeah, thank you. Look, I don't know that I would agree. Look, the President's comments yesterday that were that, if we can get a bill, he would like to get that done. I think he -- in the conversation that he was having with network anchors, he talked about the fact -- and, frankly, one of the anchors said, if anyone can get a deal, it would be you. Obviously, he was pleased with that because it's true. And I think he recognizes that a solution, a comprehensive solution has eluded our nation for a long time, and it's a big problem. And if he can get it, consistent with his principles, he will. And I think he made that clear, and the full context of those comments are just that, and in the speech he commented on as well. And I think there's a difference between sacrificing your principles to get a deal, and working with others, consistent with your principles to get a deal. And I think his principles remain consistent, and he understands that the benefit of actually enacting a comprehensive solution to a big problem that we face in the country, I think that's kind of where his head is at. Zeke. Q: Thank you, Sean. MR. SPICER: I'm sorry. Go ahead, Zeke. Q: Okay. Two for you. First, following up on Monday, the ISIS review -- the status of the review process -- who was involved and what is being (inaudible)? The President -- who else is being looped into the process? MR. SPICER: I'm sorry, I owed you that, and I will get back to you. The principals committee did meet. General Mattis shared his outline and ideas and comments, and he got a lot of feedback from the principals committee. And remember, that's -- and I'd need to get Michael to get back with you on that. I owe you that, and my apologies. I'll add it to my confession. (Laughter.)  Q: And then the second is, just following the President's line of speech last night about ""the time for trivial fights is behind us"" -- does the President believe that he has also sometimes engaged in some of these trivial fights? And going forward, should we be expecting less of these fights from him with all sorts of people? MR. SPICER: I'm going to let -- the President's vision and words last night should stand for themselves. I think he was very clear in terms of what he expects from the country.  Jessica. Q: The President talked about merit-based immigration last night. Can you talk a little bit more about what that means, and whether that indicates a desire to change legal immigration from a focus on family reunification to some sort of making sure they have a job in the United States? And was he also trying to imply that we don't have a merit-based immigration system? MR. SPICER: Well, I think he was -- look, I would just refer you back to what he said. I mean, you've got countries like Canada and Australia, in particular, that have a true merit-based system, and I think he was making it clear that we currently don't necessarily -- the results of our immigration system don't yield, necessarily, one that reflects a merit-based one. But I will say that there was, I think, a very substantial case that he made in terms of merit-based -- what he wants and how he wants to get there. Jeremy. Q: Can I have a second? I was going to have a second question. MR. SPICER: I'm sorry. Q: The President also had a comment about how many factories have left the United States since China joined the WTO. Last night his number was 60,000. A week ago, on February 23rd, he used the figure of 70,000. Just wondering what the genesis of the figure is, and what the White House believes to be the number of factories. And also whether it is truly attributable to China joining the WTO or other factors, as well. MR. SPICER: I'm going to -- we'll get somebody to follow up with you on the cite for that, as well. I went to Jeremy. Q: Is the President considering the Pentagon and his Defense Secretary more authority to greenlight raids like the kind that we saw in Yemen? And is that, in part, driven by the political blowback that that raid had initially? And secondly, could you talk about -- the initial executive order on the travel ban called for a 30-day review period to see if they would -- you would add additional countries to the list of banned -- MR. SPICER: I'll take the second one first. I can refer you back to Mara Liasson's question. (Laughter.)  On the first part, I think that he has been very clear from the get-go. He talked about some of the tactics used a while ago, and he said, I'm going to rely on General Mattis and his expertise. And I think when it comes to national security, he's got an amazing team by all standards -- whether it's Secretary Mattis, Secretary Kelly, General McMaster. There's a whole host of these -- with General Kellogg. And I think he's always talked about he's going to rely on his advisors to give him advice. I think at the end of the day there are certain decisions that have to be signed off by the President. And I would respectfully dispute the characterization of that, and I think we've pushed back and discussed this several times. There is -- this raid and action and mission was one that I think we have detailed very, very closely -- or carefully -- about the timeline for this, and when it was signed off on, and by whom. And it was initiated, signed off on by the previous administration in writing, with a signature to greenlight it. And it was further reviewed and concurred under this administration that the same basis for greenlighting it back then stood.  So, respectfully, the actual timeline and documentation does not support the accusation or the question that you're trying to ask. Q: And just as far as this was -- is nothing going to change as far as who greenlights certain raids? MR. SPICER: Well, again, I think legally -- Jeremy, I don't want to get into specifics because I think there is certain action that requires presidential sign-off. And there's certain action in terms of echelon -- the way the military works, you have different echelons that can be signed off on certain things. And I think there are certain things that have to be signed off by the President of the United States. Q: (Inaudible) protocol. MR. SPICER: So the protocol is not changing in terms of what has to be signed off, but I think that the President has made clear -- all that being said, he relies heavily on their input, their decision-making, their opinions, and their analysis and conclusions. That's different. And I think one of the issues that you saw -- or some of the criticism that you saw last administration was that you had a lot of the combatant commanders in particular who would say, we came to a conclusion, we made the case, and we weren't allowed to move forward. That's where I think the nuance that you're asking actually lies, which is --  Q: Right, so is he making a change to address that criticism? MR. SPICER: No, no, no. I think his point -- it's a philosophy more than a sort of a change in policy, which is he believes that these are the experts in this field -- as he does with all of his Cabinet. I mean, I think if you ask -- in terms of foreign policy interaction, he would say, okay, I chose Secretary Tillerson because I believe he's the right guy for this job; if Betsy DeVos has an educational matter that's going to come up. He chose these highly qualified individuals because he believes in their expertise and understanding of the issues. I think his point and his philosophy is, generally, if they come to him with a case and lay it out, then he is -- that is going to weigh heavily on his decision-making, whereas I think in the last administration, one of the major critiques was that they would come to them and then there was a preponderance -- the preponderance of time. It would be, no, we're not going to move forward with this. So I just want to be --  Phil. Q: Sean, a lot of lawmakers were heartened by the speech last night and drew a contrast from the inaugural address 40 days prior, and said that the tone was very different, the substance was different, the olive branches and outreach. Does the White House agree with that characterization? Was it on purpose? And if it was on purpose, what, over the course of those 40 days, inspired the course correction? MR. SPICER: It was not on purpose. There is no -- I mean, one was an inaugural. One was a joint address. They're two different speeches, and I think that they serve two different purposes in terms of what you're trying to lay out. I think the joint address serves as sort of a place hold for the State of the Union for first term -- or first year, first term. Q: The way he communicated. MR. SPICER: I understand -- you're right. And I think he wanted to lay out -- it's a much different and longer speech. He had different sort of messaging objectives at each. But I also dispute the notion on the inaugural. Like, I mean, I think that when you actually look at the critique, people will look at four or five different lines. But for the most part, for much -- the most part -- the high majority of that speech, he talked about the American people, the American worker, and the challenges that they face and where he thinks the country has kind of gotten off-track prioritizing them and his desire to put, what he called, the forgotten people back number one in line.  And then so one was sort of -- that was laying out his sort of vision for the presidency. This time I think it was much more of a laying out the policies of how he's going to achieve that. And that's the purpose of a joint address. So I just -- it's two different speeches, but I just don't agree with the characterization of the inaugural in the first place. Q: Was there some conclusion, though, in the White House or by the President himself that that rhetorical approach early on in the presidency, that the tweets, that the speeches -- like he did at CPAC the other day, the fighting with the media -- that that was not helping and he needed to do something different? MR. SPICER: No. No, no, there wasn't. I just -- again, I think he -- and this particular speech was a very personal -- again, like, each speech, each speech has a different audience, a different objective. And I think for this speech, he was very personal, he was very, very much him. It was his work, it was his voice, it was his words, it was his edits, it was his suggestions.  And then he had a team surrounded by him, including the Vice President, the chief of staff, Steve Miller, Steve Bannon, Jared, Ivanka was part of it. There was a -- Kellyanne, Hope -- who he would bounce ideas and objectives off of. But this was a Trump speech from his heart, as he said, that evolved over the course of the last 10 days or so. And in the last 48 to 72 hours, really accelerated, got very crisp. And it was up until about 12:15 -- excuse me, that's when I got home. (Laughter.) About 6:15 yesterday when we really started to get that real final point on it, because it was something that was very, very personal to him. But I wouldn't conflate the two and try to compare one speech with another. He looked at them as very different objectives in terms of how the speech.  I need to run. Q: But, Sean, was this a reset? Was it a reset speech? MR. SPICER: No, it wasn't a reset speech. I need to get on. I've got some things I have to take care of. But thank you. We will, as I mentioned, expect a gaggle on the way down to Hampton Roads tomorrow, and we will see you later. Thank you all. END 12:25 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-03-02,"3:44 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: I hope you guys had a great visit. I'm going to try to keep this short, obviously. We've got a short flight time home. This morning, the President was glad to see Ben Carson confirmed as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and former governor of Texas confirmed as the Secretary of Energy. He looks forward to working with them to enact his bold agenda. The Secretaries will be sworn in this evening -- Secretary Carson at 5:00 p.m. and then Secretary Perry at 5:30 p.m.  The President was honored to visit our next aircraft carrier of the United States Navy, the Gerald R. Ford, today. As he emphasized on the campaign trail and again Tuesday in his address, expansion of the United States Armed Forces is a major priority for him, and the naval fleet is a significant portion of that. Expanding our current fleet of ships requires a collaborative partnership between the military and industry leaders to ensure maximum efficiency for taxpayers. The Navy is a vital part of the President's strategy to defeat terrorism with aircraft carriers, especially important in areas where we don't have a base, from which to launch missions, project power and protect American interest.  Hand-in-hand with military leaders and the shipbuilding community, the Trump administration will continue to build extraordinary crafts like the Gerald R. Ford, protect taxpayer dollars, and support the jobs the shipbuilding industry provides, and, most importantly, keep our nation safe. While onboard today, the President received a briefing from military leaders. He then took a tour of the ship, after which he gave remarks on the hangar bay to several thousand workers and crew members and shipyard workers, which I think you all saw. The Vice President was in Ohio this afternoon with Secretary Price to discuss the President's economic agenda and especially repealing and replacing the Obamacare disaster. The Vice President then participated in a listening session with small business owners and a tour of Frame USA, an American-owned and operated small business, and delivered remarks at Frame USA. With that, you have a couple questions before we --  Q: Did Sessions lie during his testimony in January, saying he didn't have any communication with the Russians? MR. SPICER: No, I think the senator's comments were clearly with respect to his -- he was asked about his role as a surrogate and whether he understood the campaign -- whether the campaign had contacts, and he said no. It was in his -- I think clearly with respect to his role as a campaign surrogate. Q: Has the President spoken with the Attorney General about any of this? MR. SPICER: No. Q: Was the President told that General Sessions should recuse himself from the Russian --  MR. SPICER: I think that the President -- you guys got that question answered from him directly. Q: Should he provide more information to the committee, perhaps, to try to clarify his comments? MR. SPICER: I know the Attorney General is going to speak very shortly, so let's just -- I'll leave it at that. But I think the President made his views clear with you guys just a short time ago. Q: He doesn't have any concerns about whether he should have given a more clear response at the time? MR. SPICER: Well, obviously -- I mean, I'll let the Attorney General speak for himself. But I think that clearly if you listen to what he was responding to, he's clearly referring to his role as a campaign surrogate. That's what the question was about. And I think there's no --  Q: So in that role as a campaign surrogate, does that mean, like, if he was asked at a campaign rally, he's a campaign surrogate? If he's at his office, he's a senator? Like, where does one role begin and the other one stop? MR. SPICER: We're moments away from him addressing this. And it was really silly for me to try to talk about what he may or may not think. But I think most people -- almost a clear -- I don't think there's very few other ways to read it when you look at the transcript and see the back and forth that he was clearly referring to himself. He was very -- he was clear in referring to himself as a campaign surrogate and believed that that's what the question was about. But I will let -- I mean, we're literally moments away from him addressing this, and I think the President made his view clear. Q: Sean, I had a big question of what he told the Senate. Is the White House annoyed that he wasn't completely forthcoming with you guys? MR. SPICER: Forthcoming about what? I mean, he's a United States --  Q: (Inaudible) with the Russian ambassador. MR. SPICER: Wait, hold on, he's a United States senator who speaks to countless -- I mean, that's -- I mean, he was a campaign surrogate and gave the candidate at that time some ideas and advice in very important -- he had the value -- the President values his opinion tremendously, as you can tell by the fact that he wanted him in his Cabinet. But the fact of the matter is, how can you do something -- I mean, he was literally conducting himself as a United States senator. Q: Yes, of course. MR. SPICER: But hold on, and let's be clear, you look at all these other senators who have had contact, and this is what senators do in the course of conducting themselves in their job. And as you've seen, whether it's some of these folks that initially came out of the gate and said that they had never done it, the list gets larger and larger. Q: But why wouldn't he go ahead and talk -- there was already this flap about the ambassador and Flynn. Why wouldn't Sessions put it out there? MR. SPICER: Again, I'm going to let him answer it, but I think that it was pretty clear. The question was about the campaign, and I think the -- literally, correct me if I'm wrong, I don't have the question in front of me, but I think something to the effect of the campaign comments regarding the election of -- the 2016 election. So if you haven't had anything then there's nothing -- I mean, again -- Q: But (inaudible) saying he should recuse himself, and what about Nancy Pelosi and others saying he should resign? MR. SPICER: I would suggest to you that I think it's interesting that a lot of these guys -- this continues to seem to be much more of a partisan thing that we've seen over and over again. As I think I've mentioned from the -- this continues to be a question of there's no there there. And it's the same over and over and over.  Q: You think there's no there there. MR. SPICER: It's not that I don't think -- Q: (Inaudible) a Republican. MR. SPICER: I know who he is. I know it's -- but I'm just suggesting that I think the point is that -- again, I'm going to let the Attorney General speak for himself, but the bottom line is, is that for six months now we've heard the same thing over and over again, unnamed sources talking about nebulous, unnamed things, and keep having to say the same thing. At some point, you have to ask yourself where the ""there"" is. Q: Sean, we're hearing rumblings that there may not be a new travel ban coming anymore. Can you confirm that? When do you expect it then? MR. SPICER: Again, I've made this very clear to you guys. I'll say again what I've said before. I'm not -- and when the President has made a decision about something that he's ready for us to announce, we'll announce it, but we're not there yet. But again, I think that the -- Q: So you're taking your time a little bit more with it? MR. SPICER: I think that we continue to have a guiding principle doing what's right to keep the nation safe, and he's doing everything he can to consult with agencies and departments and key stakeholders. Q: And he's still committed to revising this travel ban that was blocked in court? MR. SPICER: I'm going to tell you that there's nothing that has changed from what I've said in the past. Q: General Sessions was talking about the Loretta Lynch-Bill Clinton meeting in the summer. He said at the time that there should be -- MR. SPICER: What are you talking about? Q: When General Sessions talked about the Loretta Lynch-Bill Clinton meeting in the summer, he said a special prosecutor was warranted. Why isn't a special prosecutor necessary in this case? MR. SPICER: Again, I think that the question goes back to what -- he didn't -- he was in the course of his Senate duties, did what senators do. There's no discussion -- there's nothing that would lead anyone to believe that he didn't do anything that was part of his job. Q: What was that meeting in regards to? MR. SPICER: I don't know. But, I mean, there's nothing -- it was in his Senate office. There were Senate aides, from what I understand, conducting Senate business.  Q: I don't think anybody is -- nobody is really questioning that the senator has the right to meet with the Russian ambassador in the course of his business. My question before was rather whether after -- when he's become attorney general, he didn't take the President or someone in the White House aside and say, listen, I don't think -- there was nothing untoward here but this is pertinent information given the current political climate. MR. SPICER: What pertinent information?  Q: That he met with the Russian ambassador and it wasn't disclosed to the Senate. MR. SPICER: But he probably met with countless other ambassadors. And I think -- again, he probably met with countless other associations and constituents and -- Q: So that's not something you would have wanted to know? MR. SPICER: I don't -- I guess my question is, why would we want to know everything that he did in conducting himself on behalf of the people of Alabama? Q: Okay, so you're fine with it coming out in the papers and learning about it this way? MR. SPICER: Learning about -- but here's my question: Learning about what? The fact of the matter is, if we're learning about the fact that he did his job as a United States senator, then that's great. I don't think there has been anything that I'm aware of at this time that suggests anything other than he did his job as a United States senator as, frankly, many of these other senators have now said, well, I met with this ambassador, or another ambassador. I mean, that's what senators do. Q: What about the Counsel's Office asking staff to preserve Russia-related documents, materials -- MR. SPICER: That's a pro-forma, standard operating procedure that -- and I think, frankly, it shows how serious we take this subject. Q: The President hasn't spoken to Sessions either last night or today? Why not? MR. SPICER: Why not? I mean, I think -- I'm not --  Q: Even though there's no there there -- MR. SPICER: I mean, again, I think -- Q: Have you spoken to Sessions, Sean? MR. SPICER: I'm not going to -- look, I'm just going to say that the Attorney General is going to make a statement very shortly, and I'll let that stand for itself. We're going to go down. Thank you, guys.  Q: Sean, do you have anything on al-Masri? MR. SPICER: On what? Q: Al-Masri's death? MR. SPICER: No, I -- when we land I can maybe get something. Thanks, guys.  END 3:54 P.M. EST"
Donald J. Trump: Press Gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders,2017-03-03,"12:44 P.M. EST MS. SANDERS: All right, I'll walk through -- I'll keep the opening quick since I know we're on tight time, but the President is going to spend his day here in Orlando, Florida, speaking with students, parents, teachers and administrators on how we can improve our education system and the importance of school choice. We'll be at the St. Andrew Catholic School. The President will then proceed to Palm Beach for a working weekend and returning on Sunday night to the White House. The Vice President will be Wisconsin today for a listening session with Wisconsin business leaders and their employees, and attending with him are Secretary Price and Speaker Ryan. Also attending with the President today in Florida Secretary DeVos, Florida Governor Rick Scott and Senator Marco Rubio, who is also on the plane with us today -- as well as Secretary DeVos. And with that, I will take your questions. Q: Is there any reaction from the White House to arrests in connection with the threats against Jewish community centers? MS. SANDERS: Is there any what? I'm sorry. Q: Reaction from the White House to the arrests. MS. SANDERS: I know that happened just within the last few hours and so I will get back to you on that if there's anything specific from us. But right now, it's still too early for us to say much about it. Let the process work. Q: Can you see why the White House decided that it's okay for the Keystone XL pipeline not to be built with American steel? MS. SANDERS: Well, the way that the executive order is written is actually -- and I'll get you the exact language, but you can probably all have it in your inboxes if you want to look back. But it's specific to new pipelines or those that are being repaired. And since this one is already currently under construction, the steel is already literally sitting there, it would be hard to go back. But I know that everything moving forward would be -- fall under that executive order. Q: Vice President Pence in a new story out of Indiana -- it was revealed that he used a private email server --  MS. SANDERS: Actually, it was --  Q: -- or a private email account -- MS. SANDERS: Very different. Q: Sorry. A private email account, but it was hacked. How is that different from what Hillary Clinton did? What's the difference? MS. SANDERS: There's lightyears of difference. Number one, he was a governor -- he wasn't a federal employee, which means the laws are different. It's subject to Indiana law, not federal law. Second, he's a governor, which means he wasn't handling classified information like she was. And third, all of his emails he turned over specifically to be archived, which is why anybody even knows about the account. He did everything to the letter of the law in Indiana, turned all of his emails over, unlike Hillary Clinton who lost at least 30,000, who knows how many more, had a private server, and had classified information, which he didn't have. I mean, that's an apples-to-oranges comparison. Q: Sarah, on Russia and Sessions, is the President --  MS. SANDERS: I can't believe it took us that long. Q: I know, right? MS. SANDERS: Goodness. Q: Is the President satisfied that recusal is enough for the Attorney General? He seemed to say in his statement he didn't even think that that should have happened and yet the Attorney General took that step on his own. And there are reports about other members of the President's campaign staff that had also had connections -- MS. SANDERS: Campaign volunteers, but yes. Q: -- who have been volunteers. I mean, at what point is there a ""there"" there, as Sean said there wasn't. I mean, at what point is -- I mean, there's so much out there. MS. SANDERS: Is there really? I mean, please explain to me how volunteers meeting at a conference where nearly 80 ambassadors attended is a story. I guess that part is kind of lost on me where that would be newsworthy in any capacity. I mean, Chuck Schumer sitting, having drinks with Putin and that's not a news story, but apparently a volunteer for a campaign bumping into one at a conference where there's, again, dozens of other ambassadors is newsworthy, I guess. Q: Jeff Sessions was more than a campaign volunteer, right? MS. SANDERS: As a senator, he obviously in his official capacity met with the ambassador but, again, that was a senator, not as a campaign official. And so to try to muddy the waters in that way is I think pretty unfair to the Attorney General.  Q: Why is the administration just now telling people about the meeting with Kislyak at Trump Tower? It seems like a little late, given that there was all this stuff about whether Flynn had had conversations with him. MS. SANDERS: Look, I think this, again, was a courtesy meeting. They were part of over a hundred different meetings during the transition. This wasn't like a secret -- it was just -- frankly, I didn't know about it and so I don't think anybody saw it as a big deal. There was no policy discussion. It was an introductory, courtesy meeting, which we did literally hundreds over the course of the transition. Q: With other ambassadors? How many other ambassadors? MS. SANDERS: I would have to get a specific number, but I know that there were dozens of other ambassadors.  Q: There were a number of reporters who are staked out at Trump Tower watching people go up the elevators. No one saw the Russian ambassador. Did he use a separate entrance? And if so, why? MS. SANDERS: I'm not sure, but I'll check and find out, and let you guys know. Q: To go back to Pence and the email issue for a second, is the White House certain that he's not using personal email as Vice President? And has the White House sort of checked in with all the Cabinet Secretaries and people to talk to them about using personal email versus government email? MS. SANDERS: Yeah, I know that we've all had the training on security and ethics training, and I'm also -- I will ask specifically that question, but I know that the Vice President is following the law as it's required by him. Q: Can you say one thing on the education event today -- Nancy DeVos and her -- Q: Betsy. Q: I'm sorry -- Betsy DeVos, sorry, and her support for school choice has obviously been controversial with teachers unions, with a lot of the Democrats. Is this a sort of kickoff for the President in his push to try to help her adopt school choice nationwide? MS. SANDERS: I think the point of today is exactly what it says -- it's a listening session. It's to talk about ideas and reforms that have worked, particularly at this school, which I think you guys will get the opportunity to see that.  Look, the number-one priority for education with the President has been consistent from day one. It hasn't changed, and that's to make the power and the central focus be more on the parents and the local level, and less at the federal level. And today is part of that process. Q: Is there any legislation or anything that he is going to pushing on that? MS. SANDERS: Not as of today. We'll certainly keep you guys posted if we're making any legislative announcements or bill signings. Q: There are reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is visiting the White House later this month. Can you confirm that today? MS. SANDERS: Yes, she will be there. I believe the date is March 14th, and that is confirmed. Q: What will they be discussing? MS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get ahead of their conversations, but we'll certainly provide readouts after that meeting. And I believe we plan to have a press conference with that, and they can address that directly. Q: The New York Times story about the debate over climate change and the Paris climate deal, whether the President is going to pull the U.S. out of that deal -- can you tell us where the President's mind is on that, and if we're expecting an announcement anytime soon? MS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to get ahead of the President, and he hasn't made an announcement on that, but you guys are always the first to know. Q: Can you talk a little bit about the RNC event tonight? What the President is going to do or say there, and anything else that he's going to do this weekend? MS. SANDERS: Sure. I know that it's a fundraiser. This will be the first fundraiser he has attended as President. And it's -- as you would imagine -- like pretty much every other fundraiser. The goal is to raise money for the Republican Party, and I don't expect tonight to be any different. Q: Is there any access for us? MS. SANDERS: I don't think so, as of now. I think the standard policy has usually been not to have press at fundraisers, but I'll check and let you guys know.  Q: And anything else this weekend? MS. SANDERS: I know we have some other stuff. Stephanie, who will be with you guys through the rest of the weekend, will keep you posted throughout Sunday. Q: Any update on the travel ban EO? MS. SANDERS: We don't have an announcement yet, but again, we'll let you know when we're ready to roll that out. Q: Any portions of his schedule for next week that you can preview today? MS. SANDERS: I think we will have a week-ahead guidance later tonight, and so we'll get that to you guys then. Anything else? Q: More on Sessions and Russia: The President said he learned about this, as the rest of us were learning, through media reports. Same thing with Flynn. He didn't know about the calls and the fact that they were discussing sanctions. Does the President feel like he has a full understanding of what his campaign, what his staffers, what his administration has done in terms of its relationship with Russia? Is there anything that the President feels that he doesn't know yet? MS. SANDERS: I don't think so, and I think the big point here is that the President himself knows what his involvement was, and that's zero. And I think he's the primary person that should be held responsible, and he had no interaction, and I think that's what the story should be focused on. Thanks, guys. Q: Thank you, Sarah. MS. SANDERS: You bet. END 12:54 P.M. EST"
Donald J. Trump: Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-03-06,"1:47 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everybody. Another quiet weekend. (Laughter.)  Q: You sure you don't want to do this on camera? (Laughter.)  MR. SPICER: The President signed a new executive order this morning that continues to protect the nation from terrorists entering into the United States, and a related presidential memorandum. As we've always maintained, the executive order was fully lawful in the first place, and we would have won the related legal cases on the merits. But rather than leave America's security in limbo while the litigation dragged on, some estimates having that go up to potentially a year, the President acted to protect the national security by issuing a new executive order that addresses the court's concerns, some of which merely involve clarifying the intent of the original executive order. After reviewing the facts and in thorough consultation with the Cabinet, the President had concluded these actions are necessary to protect the United States from those who, unfortunately, wish to do us harm. Two areas that I want to highlight in the executive order. There will be a 90-day suspension of travel to the United States by nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, during which time the Department of State and Homeland Security will conduct a review to determine how we can improve the screening process for foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States.  These six countries have been previously identified by Congress and the Obama administration as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism. Specifically, Iran, Sudan and Syria have been designated as state sponsors of terrorism. Libya is an active combat zone where violent extremist groups thrive in ungoverned territory. Portions of Somalia have been a safe haven for terrorist groups. Most countries don't even recognize the Somali documents.  Yemen is the site of an ongoing conflict between the government and Iran-backed armed opposition. Both ISIS and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula have exploited this conflict to expand their presence in Yemen and carry out hundreds of attacks.  These governments simply cannot or not adequately supply satisfactory information about their own nationals. In the absence of adequate information from these governments, the President has had to act to protect the security of the American people. After the original executive order, Iraq's government took steps to increase their cooperation with our immigration authorities and improve their vetting process, leading them to be removed from the list of countries covered by the temporary travel suspension. We hope other countries will also take proactive action to ensure the security of all of our nations. This is proof of both the need for and the effectiveness of the President's actions. There are a number of exceptions to this temporary travel suspension. The order explicitly states that the suspension does not apply to, one, green card holders; two, foreign nationals currently in the U.S.; three, foreign nationals currently holding valid visas; four, foreign nationals who are dual citizens of a designated country traveling on a passport issued by a non-designated country; and last, foreign nationals who have been granted asylum or admitted as refugees previously. There will also be a temporary 120-day suspension of the United States refugees' admissions program. More than 300 people who have entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the FBI. We must find a way to better screen refugee applicants to maintain the safety of our own communities. This suspension will temporarily reduce the investigative burdens on the agencies that participate in our refugee program, allowing them to properly review and revise their standards and practices. In regard to both of these provisions, the President places his full faith and trust in the experience and knowledge of his Secretary of State and his Secretary of Homeland Security. This order makes it clear that they have broad authority to grant waivers based on their expert judgments. This suspension does not apply to refugees already scheduled for travel by the Department of State, which is explicitly stated in the text of the executive order. Additionally, this suspension does not treat Syrian refugees different than any other refugees. It does not separately address the persecution of religious minorities, but does permit waivers in the cases of undue hardship. This order was drafted in close consultation with the relevant agencies. It also includes a delay-effective date of March 16th, giving those involved in its enforcement even more time to facilitate an orderly rollout.  We welcome those who come to our country wishing to contribute and share in our nation's prosperity and wellbeing, but we cannot allow our immigration system to become a vehicle for admitting people who intend to do us harm. It is the President's solemn duty to protect the American people, and President Trump has taken an important step in securing our borders through this order. Moving on to today, the President had a full day of meetings with the Cabinet and members of his staff. The President received his intelligence briefing this morning. He had a call earlier with the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, where they discussed regional security challenges. The Prime Minister thanked the President for his strong stance on anti-Semitism during his joint address to Congress last week.  The President had lunch with the Vice President, and, as I'm speaking to you now, he is beginning a meeting with the Secretary of State. Later today, he'll have meetings with his National Economic Council and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Shulkin. This evening, he'll have dinner with OMD Director Mulvaney and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, where he will talk about the repeal-and-replace efforts regarding Obamacare. With that, I'll be glad to take a few questions.  Q: Follow-up on the executive order? Have you told -- MR. SPICER: John Roberts. Q: Thank you. (Laughter.) You told us -- I figured since it's just a gaggle -- you told us many times that the President was going to continue with the case in Seattle federal court, yet paragraph 13 in the new EO says he's going to revoke the original one. What changed? MR. SPICER: As you know, he met with his team over the weekend down in Mar-a-Lago -- general counsel, Secretary Sessions, Secretary Kelly, Stephen Miller, other members of the team -- where they discussed -- continued discussing the current executive order, as well as the strategy. And they made a determination that it was best to pursue this track. And again, I think, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, we continue to maintain that the order was fully lawful but there were some legal hurdles that we'd have to potentially cross in terms of enjoinment and things like that.  So it was discussed with the President Saturday, and he made a decision that this was how he wanted to proceed going forward, based on the advice and counsel of his team. Q: DOJ has informed the 9th circuit of the existence of the new executive order. Will they move to dismiss the 48 cases that are facing that original order?  MR. SPICER: That's a good question. I know that there's the issue of both the 9th circuit and then the other ones. And I'll have to get back to you on that. I don't know what posture they're going to take, so we'll go forward. Margaret. Q: I was just going to say, would you be able to let all of us -- MR. SPICER: Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'd be glad to let everybody know.  Q: I've got a question too but I can wait until he's finished, it's fine. MR. SPICER: John, are you done? Q: Oh, I'm done. MR. SPICER: Okay. See how much nicer this is? Margaret. Q: Oh, thank you. Well, actually I'd like to move away from this subject to the other subject.  MR. SPICER: Sure. Q: Is the President going to clarify what he meant when he accused President Obama and White House officials of doing wiretaps? Is that what he meant, or did he mean that he thinks there were wiretaps that the FBI authorized? And does he want to kind of, like, amend his previous statement? MR. SPICER: I think the statement that we issued yesterday where -- President Donald J. Trump is requesting as part of the investigation of Russian activity that congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016. Neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is continued.  He wants Congress to look into this. I've spoken to the President again today. He would ask that they, additionally, look into this issue of leaks of classified and other information coming from the government. He believes that it undermines our national security and that Congress -- the intelligence communities in Congress, using their oversight authority, look into these pervasive leaks of national security -- of classified information. So he would do that.  I would note, it's interesting that when you look at what former DNI Clapper said on ""Meet the Press,"" when he was asked if there was any evidence that the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russian government while the Kremlin was working to influence the election, his quote was, ""Not to my knowledge.""  I think we've continued to see people who have been briefed and are aware of these stories that have existed -- Congressman Chairman Nunes of the Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton of the -- he's on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard Burr, Marco Rubio -- you name it, on and on and on, have said that the information that they've been provided -- and this is -- I get it, there's two separate issues here. But I think on the first one, you saw over and over again the continued comments by people who are in the know or have been in the know on that situation saying that there was no knowledge. Conversely, you saw former Attorney General Mukasey come out and talk about -- that it's pretty clear that there was some sort of surveillance or wiretaps that had to have existed. All that being said, I think that's why the President is asking Congress, the intelligence committees to use their oversight authority to further understand what's in this. I'm sorry.  Q: And so -- MR. SPICER: I'm not sorry but I knew you -- Q: No, no, no -- yeah. Just before we move on -- okay, so for now, the President is not amending what he tweeted. MR. SPICER: No. Q: And Jim Comey, in the meantime, I guess wanted Justice to knock it down. Has the President talked to Jim Comey? MR. SPICER: I'll be honest with you, I have not seen anything aside from another report based on anonymous sources that that actually happened. So aside from anonymous sources saying that a conversation happened, I'm not aware that that occurred. I don't know that we're aware that that occurred. And I, frankly, don't see anything on the record that show that that actually occurred. So just to be clear, this is one of the problems that I think occurred in the whole first set of stories. People start taking things as fact because a series of off-the-record and anonymous sources say they do. We have started to become a series of believing all of these stories, and yet -- I've addressed this in the past -- there's nothing there to substantiate it.  In fact, all of the people, from -- I mean, Clapper's comment, ""Not to my knowledge."" You saw Nunes, Rubio, all these senators and House members that have been briefed by the FBI coming out and saying, we have not seen anything, either. At some point, I would ask people to take on-the-record sources and quotes as important as the countless numbers of anonymous off-the-records.  Zeke. Oh, I'm sorry --  Q: Sean -- MR. SPICER: No, no, no, I just saw the top of a head. Hallie, I'm going to get to you, don't worry. I'm sorry, that was my bad.  Q: It's okay, it's all right. So explain this to me, then. You're talking about not using anonymous sources. What is, then, the sourcing for the President's tweet on Saturday morning? MR. SPICER: As I said, I think, look -- Q: And does he believe it's a FISA warrant. Is it some other -- of surveillance? MR. SPICER: It could be FISA. It could be surveillance. There's no cameras, slow it down. Q: So he doesn't know? MR. SPICER: Look, I think he has made it clear that there are continued reports that have been out there. I'm not going to continue to -- I think the President made it clear yesterday that he wants Congress to go in and look at this. I think there is substantial reporting out there from individuals and from sources. Q: But what sources -- MR. SPICER: Okay. Sara, you're not on camera. You don't need to jump in. We'll get to your question in turn. Hold on.  The answer is, is that the President has made it clear he wants Congress to look into this. And we're encouraging the House and Senate intelligence committees to use their oversight capabilities and look into this. John Gizzi. Q: Sean, does he not know whether -- what kind of surveillance it was? MR. SPICER: Well, I think that there's no question that something happened. The question is, is it surveillance, is it a wiretap, or whatever. But there's been enough reporting that strongly suggests that something occurred. And I think that that's why what he has said yesterday is that he wants Congress to look into this. And I think that there is enough out there now that makes one wonder how some of this happened without the existence of surveillance. Q: But when he published his tweet -- MR. SPICER: Right. Q: -- did he know what kind of surveillance? MR. SPICER: All I'm telling -- like I said, I'm going to put a pin in this and say, the statement yesterday made it very clear that he wants House and Senate Intelligence Committee members to use their oversight authority to look into this situation. John Gizzi. Q: Thank you, Sean. Has the President ever said there's hypocrisy and a double standard in the reporting of things? For example, about alleged Russian involvement in U.S. elections, and then on the other hand, relatively little attention paid to the leaking of conversations with world leaders that are classified? And does the leaking of his conversations with world leaders bother him and make him want to investigate that as well? MR. SPICER: Yeah, I mean, I think he is very concerned about that. There is obviously information that affects national security that has been leaked out that concerns him. I mean, it's -- and I think when you've seen some of the leader calls being leaked out that are sort of congratulatory or not necessarily dealing with state secrets or national security, that's one thing to seem -- but it gives you pause and concern to realize that, if you're talking about something of national security, of something that affects two of our different economies or countries, that -- whether it's China or North Korea, whether you're actually talking to them or talking about them with another leader, that there is obviously concern that those calls are getting leaked out. And I think that's why the President is also now asking Congress to additionally use its oversight authorities to also look at those leaks and wonder why that's happening.  So I think he is concerned. I think we've said it several times before, and it's obviously something that is of major concern. And, frankly, when you recognize the potential that that could have on the safety of our country, it should give everyone pause. Hallie. Q: Sean, two topics for you here. I want to clarify some questions again from my colleagues. Has the President spoken with the FBI director about the allegations he made Saturday morning, and does he have confidence in his FBI? MR. SPICER: To the best of my knowledge, I'm almost 100 percent certain that he has not, but I've not specifically asked him. I'm not aware that that occurred. Obviously I'll give myself -- and I'd be glad to get back, but I have not known that that existed. So I'm giving myself the ability to get back to you on this, but I'm not -- Q: And all of us. MR. SPICER: And all of you. We're making a list. But I am not aware that that actually happened. Q: And the confidence question. Does he have confidence in his director? MR. SPICER: There's nothing that I have been told by him that would lead me to believe that anything is different than when it was prior. Q: And before I get to the second topic, a clarification here. You're talking about the President wanting to go to Congress, specifically on the wiretapping question, but this is information that is held by the executive branch. So why would the President, if it's information the executive branch has -- MR. SPICER: Because I think that there's -- like, again, and I'm not going to -- I want to stay in my wheelhouse here. But my understanding is, is that the President directing the Department of Justice to do something with respect to an investigation that may or may not occur with evidence may be seen as trying to interfere. And I think that we're trying to do this in the proper way, and that's -- Q: So his tweets about it -- sort of saying that this information exists does not -- MR. SPICER: That doesn't interfere with an investigation.  So, Zeke. Q: Okay, the second topic was actually on the immigration executive order. The President back in January tweeted about a one-week delay on the travel ban, would have let ""bad dudes"" enter the country. This particular revised order doesn't go into effect for another 10 days. MR. SPICER: The 16th. Q: So what changed? How does that under -- does that undercut your argument that the nation was at risk? MR. SPICER: Well, I would argue that the court kind of undercut our argument by not reading the U.S. code the way it's intended to. But I think we lost the element of surprise way back when we said we were going to issue a second executive order. Q: So that's what it was about, the element of surprise? MR. SPICER: Oh, absolutely. I think we said at the beginning. The whole reason that we did it in the way that we did was because if you -- started to telegraph it. But I think that when we started talking about a second executive order a couple of weeks back, I think that that generally took away -- whether it was done on Friday or Sunday or Monday, it wouldn't have mattered. And people have been able to -- we have telegraphed what we're doing for the last couple weeks. We took that away, and the President, as you've seen, has been very methodical about making sure we've talked about this for the last week -- Q: Since the --  MR. SPICER: Right, but talking about implementing it correctly. And I think Saturday night, if you saw the group of individuals who were down in Florida sitting with him, this is part of that implementation process that we've been talking about, that we were continuing to tweak it, to get it ready to speed, overcome a lot of issues and concerns that had to get added in or out, and make sure that the government was properly -- but make no mistake, we lost the element of surprise back when we said -- when the court enjoined this in the 9th circuit, and then we had to go back to the drawing board and we talked about doing a second order. That was the intent of it the entire time. You lose that back then. Zeke. Q: Going back to the previous topic, the President calling for Congress to investigate these specific issues. Does that mean that the President is willing -- or is committing now to accepting the conclusions of these congressional investigations no matter what they say on anything? So because he's now calling for this investigation, he is now committing to accept the outcome? MR. SPICER: Well, I don't think you would ever just blanketly say ""I'm going to accept any outcome."" That doesn't matter what it is. You can go to court and -- it doesn't mean that you get found guilty or innocent that you're accepting the outcome, it means that you're agreeing that that's a legitimate -- but I think we're going to let Congress work its will. I think if we have a problem with one of the conclusions, we'll let it be known. But I think that, for right now, the issue is, is that we think that that's the appropriate place for this to be looked into. And they have the resources, and they, themselves, have admitted that. Alexis. Q: Sean, can I ask two topics? MR. SPICER: Sure. Q: On this topic, let me just follow up. If members of Congress pursue an investigation that looks into surveillance in the way the President would like them to, and he believes that that surveillance is potentially against the law, they would make recommendations to the executive branch to pursue and prosecute anyone responsible for that. So their recommendations would come back to the Justice Department. So to ask the question again, would the President accept the recommendations of the legislative branch that potentially laws were broken and that those accusations should come back to the Justice Department to investigate? MR. SPICER: I think it's hard to prejudge what they're doing. Obviously, the reason that he's asking the House and Senate Intelligence Committee to go through this is because he thinks that they are the appropriate venues. They have the appropriate staff to look at them, and I think it's an appropriate way of having that separation of powers, if you will, where it's not asking -- directing the Department of Justice to do something that they may or may not be the ones conducting. But again, the reason I don't want to give a blanket statement, Alexis, isn't because I'm trying to prejudge it. But I think that depending on a lot of things, you don't want to say, we're going to accept every single thing they do. I think we definitely will have a lot of respect for what they do and what they look into, but I think to blanketly accept -- just say, we're going to accept anything they say or do, might be a bit premature and not exactly the way to go. Q: And I had a healthcare question but before I do that, it was reported that the President was interested in having the White House Counsel pursue information that would help support the President's argument that he may have been under surveillance. Is it the case that the President has indeed asked Don McGhan to continue doing that? Or is he dropping that and -- MR. SPICER: No, Don McGhan was never asked -- all Don Mcghan was ever asked to do was to review what options, if any, were available. That's it. Just review internally and tell the President, this is what's -- but we made very clear to anyone who asked -- and if you know Don and the team here -- these are unbelievably talented lawyers. They're very skilled in understanding their -- where the bounds are, and would understand that any type of interference would be -- it was an internal review of what options, if any, were available. So it's full stop. Q: And that was completed? MR. SPICER: That guidance was made available to the President.  Q: Okay. Here's my healthcare question. MR. SPICER: It was also reported that the President's desire for speed with the administration's own Affordable Care Act replacement plan has kicked the ball to the OMB Director rather the HHS Secretary to complete that work and get it out this week. Who is in charge of actually completing that? Is it more now in the ball court of OMB rather than HHS? Or are they working together? How would you describe it, and is it still coming out this week? MR. SPICER: I believe it is coming out -- I have every intention that it comes out this week. But I think it's a joint effort. I think Secretary Price is obviously the lead; it's HHS. But Director Mulvaney, his time -- I mean, they've both served in the House and were champions of budget issues. Obviously, there's a huge budgetary impact on that, and his understanding of the budget, his role here, and, obviously, his understanding of Congress makes Director Mulvaney a great partner. So it's not a question of -- and this is the same issue that came up during the transition on trade. I think we have an unbelievably talented team -- everybody from Robert Lighthizer, when he gets confirmed as the U.S. Trade Rep, you've got Wilbur Ross at Commerce, Peter Navarro here -- it's not an either/or thing. It's I think bringing the best and the brightest together to get something through. Obamacare and repealing and replacing it with something that's more accessible, affordable, more innovative is not something that just has to land in one person's hand. It can be covered -- and I think there are great partners and great teammates. Yes. Q: Yes, please, thank you, Sean. I'm just wondering when you said that it's pretty clear that there was some sort of intelligence or wiretaps and that that's why we need to move forward with an investigation, is that based on people speaking on the record, or anonymous sources? MR. SPICER: On the record. I think General Mukasey was very much on the record when he came to that conclusion. I think that when you -- anyway. I will leave it to Congress to further follow up on that. Q: And one more, if I may. The President has yet to announce the vast majority of his sub-Cabinet-level nominations, such as Ambassador to Japan. Does the White House have a long-term timeline for all the rest of these nominations? MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think that you should -- there's a bunch of sub-Cabinet individuals and ambassadorships that should be coming out very soon. One of the things that I think -- I'm glad you kind of gave me an opportunity to touch on personnel. There was a report the other day that of, like, the 1,927 positions that -- someone went through, I think one of the things that people have to recognize is -- we talked about this a lot during the transition. We had about 600 members of these beachhead teams that went in under a special hiring process -- that they're able to be there for 120 days. For the most part, most of those people transition into Schedule C positions. It's not a given. It is not a default, meaning -- and I think we made it clear during the transition -- it's not just if you showed up for the first 120 days you get to stay. But sort of -- they were chosen specifically because of their understanding of the issue, their expertise or their desire to serve in that particular capacity. And so we actually -- when you actually look at the numbers, we are well ahead, if not on par with -- we're well ahead of almost every modern administration. I think we're right on par with Obama '08. But you think about it, of the 1,927 or so positions, we've got over 600 of those individuals, and -- most of whom so far are looking like they're fully going to convert to Schedule C. But they are performing the duties that would be done by a Schedule C.  So when you look at the totality of what we're doing, we were well ahead on the Cabinet. And again, one of the other things is, you've got Congress still holding up the Cabinet getting appointed. And so I think there's a degree to which Senate Democrats, before we get a lot of stones thrown at us about where we are on the rest, they haven't even finished the job at hand of getting the full Cabinet. Jon Decker. Q: Thanks a lot, Sean. Two questions on the executive order. With the first executive order, there was a lot of fanfare when the President signed that executive order; in the Oval Office today, not so much. We didn't see the President, no cameras, no pool. Why didn't he want to show us him signing this new executive order? MR. SPICER: I tweeted a picture out.  Q: That's your picture, that's not independent -- Q: Well, I know -- from today. Yeah, that's your -- MR. SPICER: I know, I'm -- I think -- (laughter) -- there are three agencies that are dealing with -- to your point, we went through this. We talked about the courts issue, we talked about this ad nauseam; the President got asked about it over and over again. I think today was about the implementation of it, was about having the three Departments that are expressly named to implement this to talk about what they're doing to implement it. And I think they did a phenomenal job about it. And that's what we wanted to highlight today, is the government getting it done. And the way that the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State were implementing the measures that the President laid forth -- again, if you think about it, the principles of the executive order remain the same. We looked at what the court said, we put together a thing -- we consulted with the relevant agencies and Departments. We talked to Congress. We had an extensive morning of briefings. The call to the press lasted about an hour, I guess. And so we made sure that everybody knew what we were doing. We sent them out to make sure that the American people could see what they were doing.  And so I just want to be clear that I think we did a phenomenal job of rolling it out and making sure the American people saw the faces of the Departments that were instrumental in implementing it.  I'm sorry, Jon, go ahead. Q: That's all right. The second one has to do with this idea of ""element of surprise."" With the first executive order and also with this one, there's a 90-day temporary ban on residents entering this country from six predominantly Muslim countries. What's to stop a so-called ""bad dude"" from one of these countries from coming into the country on the 91st day, or the 92nd day? Why 90 days? Doesn't that get rid of that element of surprise when you say -- MR. SPICER: No, I think that -- no, but -- thank you, that's actually an interesting question. I think part of it is, is that we feel confident that during that 90-day period, the processes could be put in place. Now, remember, there's two key things that are important. Number one is these six countries are the ones that we don't have the information currently that we feel comfortable -- and as I lifted off why -- I mean, there are some that literally are state-sponsors of terror. And I think when you recognize -- I don't think there's any American that wants a country that is a state-sponsor of terror to be sending their individuals here without us properly vetting them. You talk about Yemen, the documents that people use in Yemen are not accepted by a whole host of countries because they lack the integrity to ensure that they are not compromised. And I think that there is a big difference in that, but we can -- at the end of that 90-day period, we can let a country off, we can expand the list of countries, we could indefinitely address the countries that are on the list, we could expand that list to other countries that aren't on it. But there's two things that are happening. One is, we're putting a ban on those countries, the six that are named. But two is, we're looking at an entire -- at the rest of the entire world, and all of the procedures that we use to address all countries.  And so at the end of that period, we could add countries. We could subtract countries. We could decide to indefinitely continue with one of the two -- one of the six, rather. But if you look at the case of Iraq, after the first order, they stepped up with four very specific things that they did to ensure that people traveling from Iraq, we had certain things -- whether it be biometrics and others -- that let us ensure that people coming into the country, we felt confident in knowing that they were coming in. But that's an important thing. It's not just those six. We're looking at that time -- we're dealing with those during that 90-day -- but we're also looking at everybody else at the same period. Kaitlan. Q: So why doesn't the order prevent people who didn't have visas by the day of the first order from coming in the country? Because wouldn't that safeguard from the people who went and got visas during this revision period?  MR. SPICER: I would just say I think that there's appropriate steps that have been taken during that period to ensure that the homeland has been protected. Go ahead, I know you have another one. Q: Just one more question. MR. SPICER: Of course. Q: Does the President think that Barack Obama himself wiretapped him, or someone in the administration? MR. SPICER: I'm just going to say that as the President noted in his statement, we're going to let Congress look into that and then we'll get back to you -- we'll discuss it after Congress comes with -- Erin. Q: Since the President contends that he and President Obama like each other, has he picked up the phone and called President Obama since the inauguration, or did he think about asking him directly before accusing him publicly? MR. SPICER: I have not -- I'm not aware of whether or not they've talked. I can ask and find out and get back to you. Cecilia. Q: Does the fact that you're rescinding this first executive order -- is it at all an admission that things just didn't go right the first time around? MR. SPICER: No. I think the first executive order, we've made clear time and time again -- when you look at how the court adjudicated that, their facts were wrong. Just in terms of how many people had come into the country, they based it off of several things that I think were not factually accurate. I think we recognized that we could have been in litigation for up to a year on this, and that would have left the country exposed.  And I think that that's -- there is a goal here that we sought to achieve the first time that we have to maintain. But by no means -- we 100 percent maintain that the executive order as initially drafted is completely constitutional and legal, and that what we've done is to do the best of our ability based on what the court -- Q: Sean -- MR. SPICER: Hold on, it's still Cecilia's turn. Q: Thank you. What about this issue of radicalization after people are here, which is what DHS raised in that report? One of the examples that's cited in the EO today is the Somali man, now, who came as a child and was radicalized here. So what does this order do about that population of people? MR. SPICER: The people that are here -- Q: That are here, which is what -- the concern that DHS raised in this report, that said people -- the bigger concern is people who are here and are radicalized after the fact, not those that are here just stopping to -- MR. SPICER: I think that what we need to do -- this isn't a one-stop shop. I think that we have to look at this -- the entire problem. This is one piece of the problem that we're looking at to make sure that we keep the country safe. It's not a either/or, or only-this-then. But I think you're going to see a continuation of steps that the President takes to make sure that the country is protected. One small correction that I've been made aware of, it's Somalia, not Yemen, that the travel docs are not accepted. So my apologies to Yemen.  Jeff, did you -- hold on. Thanks. Jeff. Q: Thank you, Sean. You've mentioned a couple times and referred a couple times today to DNI Clapper -- former DNI Clapper's comments on -- over the weekend about Russia and the Trump campaign. Are you encouraging people to take those comments seriously but not the comments where he said there was no wiretapping? MR. SPICER: No, I'm just -- well, first of all, he also said that he wasn't aware -- he couldn't speak entirely when it came to wiretapping. He said that he wasn't aware of anything. I take him at his word that he wasn't aware, but that doesn't mean that it didn't exist. But I also think that it's interesting that the double standard that has existed for so long when it comes to -- you have these sources over and over again who have been briefed by the FBI that say, I was briefed, there's nothing there. You have Clapper saying, ""Not that I'm aware of."" And yet, we still have these stories over and over again citing anonymous sources. At some point, you have to question how many times are you going to take ""didn't see anything there"" before we start seeing these stories getting rewritten over and over and over again? I think that is a valid question. It's interesting how everyone today is asking what sources we have, and yet we've been asking the same question about the sources for these anonymous sources and story after story for the last six months. And it's just, don't worry, we have these trusted anonymous sources that may or may not be true. And at the bottom of every story it has some kind of caveat that -- however there has been no formal evidence presented. I think there's been a malignment for so many months about what may or may not have happened, and yet not a shred of single truth has actually come that shows any evidence that existed except for anonymous source after anonymous source after anonymous source. Q: On a different issue?  MR. SPICER: Yeah. Q: What is the White House's reaction to North Korea firing four ballistic missiles into the sea off of Japan's northwest? MR. SPICER: The launches are consistent with North Korea's long history of provocative behavior. The United States stands with our allies in the face of this very serious threat. The Trump administration is taking steps to enhance our ability to defend against North Korea's ballistic missiles, such as through the deployment of a THAAD battery to South Africa -- South Korea. Q: I just want to circle back around to a couple things that you said. You said it could be FISA, it could be surveillance. So are you saying that the administration is conceding that somewhere there was evidence presented before a judge that shows there could be collusion with the campaign and that it was okay to surveil them? MR. SPICER: No, what I'm suggesting is that, as I said, that our goal is to allow Congress to do its job, as the statement said yesterday. Olivier. Q: And then the follow-up on the new order. You had said that there are a hundred or so that had been inspected, but how many total that came in that you all have detained.  MR. SPICER: It's 300. Q: Of 300 -- 100 refugees? You said hundreds of -- or 300 refugees. How many total came in, and how many did you detain? MR. SPICER: I'd ask you to talk to the Department of Justice -- actually, Homeland Security on that one. I know the top-line stat on that one. Olivier. Q: A couple for you. One, just scheduling. The Israeli defense minister is in town tomorrow. Will he meet with the President? MR. SPICER: I'll have to get back to you on that. I'm not aware that that's on the schedule at this time, but -- I don't know. I know that he and Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke earlier. I'm not aware that that came up. Q: And can you flesh out this notion of 300 refugees being investigated? What are they being investigated for, specifically? What's the source for this information -- MR. SPICER: The FBI. Q: So the FBI is investigating 300 refugees currently on U.S. soil on terrorism-related charges? MR. SPICER: That's what I have been -- yes. I'll get you the stat for that, but that's -- Q: That would be great. Thank you. MR. SPICER: Anita. Q: Can you talk a little bit about Iraq and how they're not -- why they're not in the executive order anymore? So is this a signal to the other six and to other countries that they can also get removed if they -- I think you called it ""proactive,"" if they were proactively having their own actions?  MR. SPICER: I think what I would say, and I think the way you phrased it is right. It's not just the six countries, it's countries throughout the globe. I think that we are -- it is in every country's best interest to know who's coming in and out of its country and to do things. And I think there are things that we've asked countries to do. And it's not inclusive, it's not ""have you hit these four."" I think each country is a separate case. So I don't want to say, ""if you do these four you're in.""  Q: But is it possible, then, to -- MR. SPICER: Absolutely. I think there is -- now, in some cases, like anything else, Anita, it may be easier for one country to achieve something than for another. But at the end of the day, I think there are certain things that -- there are certain steps that Iraq went through, including things like biometrics and turning over lists of -- updating lists, rather, of people within their country that have -- that pose a threat.  And so that -- they've agreed to do certain things after the first one was ordered that give us a much greater degree of confidence in knowing who is coming in and out of the country. Q: And then on another topic. What was the President's reaction to hearing about Vice President Pence's email use, personal email for government business? I ask, obviously, because he had so many things to say about Hillary Clinton using personal email for government business last year? MR. SPICER: I was going to insert, like, an AOL joke here. (Laughter.)  But I think, look, I don't -- I think there's a big difference. The Vice President complied with Indiana law, turned over all of his emails and made sure that everything was done. I mean, that's a very big step. There's no question that I've been made aware of that he didn't do everything in compliance with Indiana law. There's a big difference between doing what is common practice within a state government and what is in compliance with that state's laws, then setting up a private server that seeks specifically to go around the government protocols and the Federal Records Act. There's a big difference between that. But I mean, the governor at the time, and now the Vice President, did everything in compliance with Indiana law. And I think that's a big difference, is that it's not a question of -- it's a question of was there a law and was there a rule and did you follow it. In the case of Governor Pence, he did. In the case of Secretary Clinton, I would let the record speak for itself on that. Sara. Gabby, I'm sorry. Q: Thanks, Sean. Part of the justification for the hurried rollout of the initial executive order on immigration was that if it wasn't rolled out immediately, that people would take advantage of that and come into the country. So why has the administration decided to delay the implementation of this new executive order until March 16th? MR. SPICER: I'm going to refer you Hallie Jackson. (Laughter.) That was what Hallie asked earlier. Q: Sorry. MR. SPICER: No problem, it's in the -- but basically the answer that I gave Hallie that I'll give to you is, I think the first order -- one of the goals of the first order was an element of surprise, to implement it in a way that didn't allow people to get in, right? Since the 9th Circuit acted, we've been talking about a second executive order. I think we lost the element of surprise back in mid- to early February when the 9th Circuit acted the way they did. So that element -- what we've tried to do now is to make sure, with that element gone, that we've implemented this in a way that ensures the greatest degree of confidence that we know what we're doing. One quick item -- I'm not done, so don't -- you can keep your hands -- someone asked earlier, and I'm trying to remember who, about the source for DOJ. Was that you, Olivier? The Department of Justice, FBI investigation, section one, subsection H, the text of the EO notes -- you can check on that for the source. I'm sorry. Matt. Q: Thanks. Sean, doubling back to something we talked about earlier. President Trump accused President Obama of criminal conduct. One, can you tell us what his source was for that accusation? Two, can you tell us, unequivocally, that he was basing that on more than a talk radio report and a Breitbart article about that talk radio report?  MR. SPICER: I'm going to tell that -- I've said it over and over again, I think the President made it very clear in the statement yesterday that he is not going to comment any further on this until Congress does -- Q: So maybe it was just based on the talk radio report? MR. SPICER: I'm not going to -- I'm just going to say that the President made it very clear that, based on numerous things, including -- and I think there's a New York Times story on it, there's several sources that made this clear or brought this to light -- but I'm not going to go into anything further, as the President noted, until this is resolved. Mara. Q: I have two topics. One, on the EO that maybe is coming later this week -- an EO on the Obama administration's fuel-economy standards. Are you going to have an EO reversing those, and will that also negate California's waiver? MR. SPICER: I don't see anything on -- I'll have to get back to you, as my standard. I'm not so sure on the timing -- I was just looking at my date.  Q: Oh, okay. Thank you.  MR. SPICER: But I'd just -- I wouldn't get -- I don't have anything to announce at the time, is generally how I answer that, and I'm going to stick to it. Q: Okay, but I have just one more question on the other topic. You said that you pointed rightly to Clapper's comments -- nothing that he knows of suggests there was any collusion between the campaign and Russia. But he also said that he didn't know of any wiretap FISA order. Why are you willing to accept his -- MR. SPICER: That's what Jeff asked. Q: Well, I guess the thing I'm asking is that the President of the United States has unilateral authority to declassify anything that he wants. He said in his tweet, I just learned of this. So he obviously had some kind of evidence. Why not declassify it? MR. SPICER: I think that's -- as I have made clear, there's a reason that we want Congress, the intelligence committees to do their job in terms of making sure that there's a separation of powers.  Q: He's afraid it would look like interference? MR. SPICER: I think that, again, I'm just going to leave it at that he thinks it's appropriate for Congress to do this instead of trying to point to his own Department of Justice. Ashley. Q: Sean -- MR. SPICER: Hold on, you're going to wait your turn. It's Ashley's turn. Q: Thank you. This morning, Kellyanne Conway went on Fox News and she said, ""He's the President of the United States. He has information and intelligence that the rest of us do not."" So that seemed to be referring not to these news reports you're talking about, but to specific, tangible evidence. So what can you tell us about what that evidence is, where it came from? And then secondly, if he has this evidence, why is he asking Congress to investigate? MR. SPICER: Well, I just -- I think the point that Kellyanne was making at the time is that the President, because he's President, gets access to NSC and other intelligence documents. I don't know -- I haven't seen the exact transcript, so I can't -- Q: I can read it to you. MR. SPICER: I appreciate that, thank you. But I also haven't talked to Kellyanne about it, so I don't think you can do that part. But I don't -- so I can't specifically respond to you in terms of what she was referring to, whether she was referring to the exact nature of his charge or whether, generally speaking, he is given information. But again, on all of this, I'm going to go back to the statement earlier that the President's goal right now is to make sure that House and Senate can do this -- yes. Q: Thank you, Sean. China is retaliating against the THAAD deployment in South Korea. What is the U.S. position? MR. SPICER: It's retaliating against what? Q: Against the THAAD deployment in South Korea, THAAD battery deployment. MR. SPICER: The THAAD battery? Q: Yes. MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think we're going to work with South Korea. I mean, obviously, North Korea's missile launches present a danger to our friends down south. And I think, as I mentioned in our response, we're going to continue to work with the government of South Korea to address this thing. Q: Would the U.S. -- the Chinese government? MR. SPICER: I'm not at this point -- huh? Q: -- the Chinese government? MR. SPICER: We have not had any further conversations on this. I think this is consistent with U.S. policy.  Margaret. Q: Sean, two points of clarification. Did the President mean in any way to suggest that the FBI broke the law, or any other intelligence agencies, with this allegation of wiretapping? MR. SPICER: In the tweet?  Q: Yes.  MR. SPICER: I'm just going to let the tweet speak for itself. I'm not going to get into -- Q: Well, that's why I'm asking this question? MR. SPICER: I get it, but I think that I'm not going to try to -- Q: Because it opens that up. MR. SPICER: I understand that, and I think I will seek further clarification on that. For right now, I would just suggest to you that I'm going to let it speak until I can get further clarification. Q: My second point of clarification here. You said, you know, you didn't want to really get into what the triggering event was for the tweet in the first place, but I want you to address this part if you would. The question has been raised -- or the allegation has been raised that the President was simply trying to change the topic off of an unfortunate news cycle that week. Can you address that portion of the question, that this was deliberately about changing the media narrative and not anything having to do with the story itself? MR. SPICER: No, I don't -- I mean, that's -- I have nothing to lead me to believe that that was the case. I'm not sure -- and I think he had a great week last week. He had a phenomenal joint address. We had a great visit down in Norfolk, talked about rebuilding the military. He was in Orlando, in Florida, talking about how school choice can help children and parents and create better schools.  So I just -- I can't say that I've talked to him specifically about this, but I think the President had a good week. And so I don't see any reason that he would be using -- I mean, that just -- I think it was an issue of concern to him. Q: Sean, let's remind everybody what the President did tweet Saturday morning: ""Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory."" He later called Obama a stupid guy -- or whatever it was exactly -- a sick guy. Yeah, sorry. Are the American people supposed to pull back and suddenly think that this is not the President of the United States accusing his predecessor of committing a crime when he writes it that way? MR. SPICER: Look, I think the President speaks very candidly. His tweets speak for themselves, as we've said before, and he's asked the House and Senate committees to look into this. Sara. Q: Considering the scrutiny surrounding President Trump's then-campaign advisors and Russia, which has carried over at the White House, is he reconsidering at all his hope or his timeline for pairing with Russia to fight ISIS? MR. SPICER: Is he -- based on -- Q: Just based on the amount of scrutiny surrounding his -- MR. SPICER: No, I mean, I think if Russia wants to join with us to fight ISIS, that's a great -- Q: So nothing has changed on that front? MR. SPICER: No. Q: And secondly, in light of the fact that there were previously undisclosed communications between the Russian ambassador and Michael Flynn and Jeff Sessions and Jared Kushner, has White House counsel done anything proactively to try to go to senior staffers or other Cabinet-level officials and say, hey, if you have had contact with a Russian official that you have not previously disclosed, then now is the time to do it? MR. SPICER: Not that I'm aware of. I'm not aware of any of that. I would say that there's -- one of the things that is interesting that, you know -- in the course of people conducting their business here at the White House or during a transition or in the House or the Senate, you contact a whole host of people -- diplomats, government officials, you know, association representatives, corporate representatives. I mean, that's -- those are the kind of folks that talk to people in government.  And I think that there's one thing between talking with somebody -- I mean, I think -- and again, I'll get back to you so don't be prescriptive on this. I think someone had told me earlier today that there were something like 20 visits to the Russian ambassador in the last, you know, 10, maybe, years. I don't -- huh?  Q: Twenty-two. MR. SPICER: Twenty-two. Thank you for helping fact check me. (Laughter.)  Q: -- is not here, so somebody's got to do it. (Laughter.)  MR. SPICER: Thank you. Where's Knoller? But I think at some point, there's nothing wrong with people doing their job, right? I mean, that's what I think that there is a big difference between so-and-so met with someone. There's nothing to disclose with a meeting. If I have a meeting with a member of the media, no one says, hey, did you know that you need to report every time you meet with this individual or this outlet or whatever. There's nowhere to report that kind of stuff. There's a big difference between doing something nefarious or illegal and conducting yourself in a routine course of business. Q: But there were clearly a number of instances where people in this administration suggested they did not have any contact or misled you guys about the amount of contact they had, which has then caused some unflattering news cycles. MR. SPICER: Well, and I think -- so in one case, Michael Flynn was, you know -- the President said the inconsistencies and him not being straight with the Vice President -- he asked him to resign. I think the President dealt with it. But that was -- again, if you note the President's comments at the time, he was very clear that the issue wasn't that he's doing his job. The issue was him misleading the Vice President. And that's a very different thing. So he had no problem with him doing his job and contacting individuals that we were going to need to be in contact with during the administration. And that's where I think there is a big difference between a lot of these stories saying, did you know that so and so did this? There's nothing wrong with people meeting with ambassadors, or government officials, or corporate representatives, or members of the media. That's part of what we do in government.  And so I think there's a big difference in the question that you're asking about whether or not someone is doing something that's wrong and inappropriate or illegal, and someone doing what they would do in a normal course of business. Q: Well, I think the other question is just whether there have been more instances in this that are going to catch you guys by surprise since he -- MR. SPICER: And I guess -- Q: -- the President himself has denied that there was any kind of this contact throughout the campaign, and then we found out there were national security -- MR. SPICER: But hold on. Actually --  Q: -- advisors you didn't mention meeting with the Russian ambassador as well as Jeff Sessions, and then there was this meeting with Michael Flynn, as well as Jared Kushner, which was not previously disclosed. MR. SPICER: Okay, so there's two things. You said the President found out about this. What's ""this?"" Having a meeting? Again, I don't think that -- there's countless meetings that members of his senior staff and the rest of people throughout government have on it every day. That's why he's asked us to come here and work, is to facilitate some of these meetings and get some of this stuff done. There is no one to disclose stuff to. I don't disclose the --  Q: That sounds like you're saying you're not concerned that they're --  MR. SPICER: No, it's not that I'm not concerned. I guess there's -- but what I'm getting at, Sara, is that there's a difference between being concerned about somebody -- I could equally be concerned that if a member of the media said, hey, I want to take a member of your staff out, and we're going to break some kind of ethics rule. I would be concerned about that. But I wouldn't be concerned if they said, hey, we want to go have coffee with a member of the media.  They don't disclose all that on our staff. And I think -- but that's essential to your question is, is a meeting -- there's nothing wrong with a meeting. There's nothing wrong with meeting with a government official, or a diplomat, or a member of the media, or a corporate individual, or association, or a constituent, or a citizen that has an issue. But on any of those categories, once they cross the line and do something wrong, and I think to the answer of your question, the issue was specifically -- or the question surrounded attempts to influence the election. Those are very different than people meeting also during a transition period, or people meeting in their White House capacity. But those are three separate instances. All of the stories that I've heard so far, previously all detailed just action with respect to the campaign and Russia's attempt to influence the campaign, right?  Q: Yes, I mean, I think -- MR. SPICER: Yes, I mean that's --  Q: That was the backdrop.  MR. SPICER: Right. That's the backdrop. And then -- and so I think in the one instance where it happened where there was someone that misled someone, they were let go.  So for you to start asking questions about, well, what if these other individuals had a meeting? Well, were they ever asked about it? I mean there's a big difference between did someone meet with someone; and did someone mislead somebody about meeting someone. And that is a very, very big difference in those questions. And that's one of the things that I think is important to distinguish. People can meet with people. The question is did they do something wrong. Did they mislead somebody? And those are all very, very different categories. April. Q: Okay, Sean, I have a couple of topics. And back on this following up, so the question is: Under what capacity was he in when he met with the ambassador? And what did they talk about? MR. SPICER: Who is he? Q: Sessions. MR. SPICER: I don't know.  Q: And then under -- then when he was under oath, he said he didn't do it. But then we find out later, so what do you say --  MR. SPICER: No, no. Well, first of all, I'm not going to -- I'll refer you back to the Department of Justice. I know -- my understanding is he's amending his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee from what I've heard. So I'll let his people -- but I do think that his explanation that he gave was very -- was that he was answering a question did you have any meetings with anyone with respect to the campaign.  And I think in his mind, it was very clear that, I never met with anybody with respect to the campaign. I met with someone in my Senate office, in my capacity as a United States senator, with Senate staff to discuss foreign policy or whatever it was that he was discussing.  I think the Senator discussed this in his media conference last week Thursday. So I don't -- I guess the issue is with respect to what was talked about, I don't know. That's up to him. But I do think the way he described it was very clear that he believed he was answering Senator Franken's question with respect to activity involving the campaign and attempts to -- as I said to Sara, like this whole idea of influencing the election. Meeting with an ambassador about an area of foreign policy in his Senate office with his Senate staff was clearly not a campaign event. Q: Okay, so now on the leak issue. You're talking about Congress doing an investigation. But some of these leaks are coming from top officials, people who know insider information. What has the President said to his staff as it relates to the leaks in reference to trying to find out himself, not just from top-level people, what has he said to people about the leaks, about trying to stop it, or trying to find out what's happening?  MR. SPICER: Well, I think the President made clear in his comments when he stood before you all a couple weeks ago that his main concern is national security. That's -- when he keeps talking about the leaks, his concern is the leaks that damage and undermine national security, the leaks that deal with classified and other information. That's what his main concern is. And I don't think -- that's not a White House issue. That's sort of -- that is an issue that is beyond the White House. We're not --  Q: Other leaks don't matter, but the national -- MR. SPICER: No, no, I think -- it's not that other leaks don't matter. I think his issue that he has talked about and his concern is the leaks of national security. It's not that he's saying, other leaks are okay.  But I think the ones that threaten our public safety or potentially put our country in harm are the ones that he really cares about.  Peter. Q: I have a question. I'm sorry. This President reached out to former President Obama several times when he was President.  MR. SPICER: That's right.  Q: They started building something. There was a bridge. Now some people in the Obama camp are considering these conversations about, or these tweets crazy. And the question is now: With this divide between these two, and President Trump may need to one day reach back to former President Obama, how do you think that will play out? Do you think that these two will never come back together again? Is this something he could have talked to him about before he went on Twitter? There is now a chasm. There's a divide that wasn't there a couple of weeks ago. MR. SPICER: Okay, well, there was a divide during the campaign, too. I don't think that -- I think that, as you saw, and the President has made it very clear, he said some things about the President. And the President said stuff -- about the campaign. I think they came together for the good of the country. And in cases where they can come together for a common good and to talk about what's in the country's best interests, they will. But I understand your point. I just think the President --  Q: Did he burn a bridge? Q: Hold up, hold on. MR. SPICER: Thank you. But I think that they'll be just fine. So go ahead. That's you.  Q: Oh, good. MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: Hi, Sean. MR. SPICER: Hi, Julie. You've been very patient. Q: Yes, I have. Thanks. MR. SPICER: I think it's your first time. Q: It is, yes. MR. SPICER: Well, welcome. See how pleasant this is? Q: I was feeling like how can I not get called on my first time? Ten years ago, Bob Levinson disappeared in Iran. And I know the President talked about this a little bit on the campaign trail. Is there anything you can tell us about how the administration is approaching this case? Have they been in communication with his family or any updates on that? MR. SPICER: I think we put out a statement from the NSC on Friday on this -- Victoria. I think we -- so we have been in communication with his family. I believe they were here -- or we were in touch with them last week. And obviously, we continue to hold out hope. But the administration has been in touch with his family.  Q: Sean, the call to Netanyahu, what prompted that?  MR. SPICER: I don't know, Dave. I'll find out. I just know it happened. And I got a little bit of a --  Q: As you might know, the Prime Minister is meeting later this week with Vladimir Putin. Did the President and the Prime Minister talk about Syria at all? MR. SPICER: I don't know. I know that they had a discussion about regional threats, so I don't want to get ahead of this. David Jackson. Q: Comey did tell people this weekend that President Obama did not order these wiretaps, and he did want the Justice Department to put out that statement. Does President Obama believe --  MR. SPICER: Are you -- like I said, I am not -- wait, so --  Q: Does President Trump believe Comey when he says that President Obama did not authorize these wiretaps? MR. SPICER: My question is, is that I don't think that we've confirmed that Director Comey did say that. I don't -- I'm not aware. Aside from reading stories that cite anonymous sources saying that he did, I'm not aware that that actually happened. So that's the first issue that I think we need to resolve. Q: Well, people we trust did tell us that he did. MR. SPICER: Well, with all due respect, not you, but I think that we've had a number of reports that I've seen that -- about things that have occurred in the last 40-some-odd days that actually didn't occur, but anonymous sources said they did. Peter Alexander. Q: Sean, to be clear, you said earlier as an on-the-record source for the President's wiretapping claims, he referred to the former Attorney General Michael Mukasey. I just want to ask you to clarify if you could because his public comments were on Sunday, a day after the President tweeted about this. And even in his public comments, he said that he based his information ""on news reports."" MR. SPICER: Okay. But I'm just saying that he is -- someone asked whether it was an on-the-record comment. And that is on the record. Q: But I was saying, was there an on -- you were being asked was there an on-the-record comment in advance of the President's tweets to which he was basing his information? Did he have anything better than anonymous sources? MR. SPICER: I don't -- I'm not -- as I said before, I'm not going to get into the elements of that. I'll just -- I'm going to wait until the House and Senate. Q: Really, just on a past comment that the President had made about the suggestion that there were -- or the claim, in fact, that there were 3 million to 5 million people who voted illegally in this country -- he made this claim more than a month ago. I just want to get a sense now on the update on any investigation into that and where it stands, given the explosive nature of such a claim. MR. SPICER: I think we've touched on this, but he has asked Vice President Pence to lead a task force on this. We have -- I'll get more for you. I know that there's been some discussion with some Secretaries of State and others on some of this. I know you had that issue in Texas come -- last week, and I'm trying to remember the exact nature of it, but there has been now further evidence that people have voted illegally. And I think that one of the things the task force is looking to do is to gather additional information of what -- it's still in the process of getting the task members named. Q: Does the task force, I guess, exist yet? Or is -- MR. SPICER: Yeah, the Vice President has been talking to folks potentially to serve on it, and I know that several Secretaries of State have expressed -- Q: It hasn't convened yet, but he's been talking to folks about it. MR. SPICER: That's correct. That's correct. Q: Sean, two subjects here, following up on the wiretap question. Stepping away from what the President knew or the basis of his tweets, how appropriate is it for a President to make an explosive charge as fact and then send you folks out to step away and say this maybe happened and we should investigate it? MR. SPICER: Well, again, I think there's two things. One is the President's tweets speak for themselves. We're making that very -- Q: But -- MR. SPICER: Hold on. And I think the President has been very clear, as we've stated, that I think there's enough there that we want the House and Senate intelligence to use the resources they do to make sure that they look into this matter. I mean, that's -- there is -- anyway, I do not want to get ahead of where they may go with this or what they may look at, but I'm going to leave it to them. If we start down the rabbit hole of discussing some of this stuff I think then we end up in a very difficult place. I look forward to seeing you guys tomorrow. If you can bring your cameras -- Q: Sean, housekeeping-wise, you said that we'd get some clarification on a number of questions -- to all of us. If you could do that today through the pool --  MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think we can try to do that through the pool. If not, we'll write everything -- we generally write down everything and try to get back to the reporters. So I will have the team -- and then get it out by the pool. Q: Will we be hearing from the President this week, since we didn't today? MR. SPICER: I'm sure at some point we'll do either something that we -- a photo spray or something. I think that we have a pretty good track record of making the President available to folks.  Q: -- kind of unusual. MR. SPICER: What's unusual?  Q: To not --  MR. SPICER: It's Monday. Q: Exactly. Q: But you see -- everything is closed. Normally we have a photo spray or something. MR. SPICER: I just -- I think that's -- don't give me this ""normally we do."" I made it very clear at the beginning of this, April, that we have some things on camera, some off. Last week the President traveled two days, he had the joint session. We briefed every single day -- Q: It's not about us, it's about the American public seeing their President. And we have to --  MR. SPICER: Wait, hold on. Seeing their President. The guy is in meetings all day. I'm trying -- how many times did you complain about the President -- Q: He signed executive orders. You had us -- last week you said --  MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on. He signed an executive order. I mean, this is a President, when it comes to accessibility and allowing the press access, I think I've heard from several of you -- we have gone above and beyond allowing the press into events, into sprays. We've had greater access.  So, with all due respect, I mean that's not been the case. One day out of the last 41 or 40, whatever it's been -- but I think this President has been extremely accessible, extremely transparent, as far as -- he signed an executive order this morning that we then put all three Cabinet Secretaries that were relevant to implement this out. I'll be out tomorrow. I think we have an opportunity -- look, I made it very clear from the beginning of this that we'd have a briefing every day. We've gaggled every day, we've made ourselves available to you. So, with all due respect, that's not a very accurate assessment of how we've been acting. Thanks. I'll see you guys tomorrow. END 2:50 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-03-07,"1:36 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Hey, guys. I brought a guest. Good afternoon. First off, at the top, I want to acknowledge that there's been an additional wave of threats to Jewish community centers and Anti-Defamation League offices. According to some reports, there have been over a hundred bomb threats phoned in to Jewish institutions since the start of this year alone. As the President said at the beginning of his joint address, ""We're a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its forms. We denounce these latest anti-Semitic and hateful threats in the strongest terms."" It is incredibly saddening that I have to continue to share these disturbing reports with you, and I share the President's thoughts that he fervently hopes that we don't continue to have to share these reports with you. But as long as they will -- as long as they do continue, we'll continue to condemn them and look at ways in which we can stop them. Now, on to news of the day. You saw President Trump yesterday continue to deliver on two of his most significant campaign promises: protecting the country against radical Islamic terrorism, and repealing and replacing Obamacare with a patient-centric alternative. We talked a lot about the executive order protecting the nation from foreign terrorists entering the United States yesterday. And so, on to Obamacare. I'd like to introduce the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, to come up and talk to you a little bit about the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. Dr. Price. SECRETARY PRICE: Thanks, Sean. Good afternoon. First, let me just share with you what an honor it is to serve as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. I'm the third physician out of 23 individuals who've had the privilege of serving as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. And the mission at our department is to improve the health and safety and well-being of the American people. And we take that mission very, very seriously. And for many Americans, right now, their ability to gain healthcare or health coverage is a real challenge. For most Americans, they receive their health coverage through their employer. It's about 175 million folks. Those individuals will see no significant change other than there won't be a penalty for not purchasing coverage. For the folks in the Medicare system, there will be no changes at all in the current law. But we're talking about those people in the individual and small-group market, the moms and pops, the folks who run the corner grocery store, the corner cleaners. Those individuals out there are having huge challenges gaining care and gaining coverage. And then Medicaid is a program that by and large has decreased the ability for folks to gain access to care, and we want to make certain that we address that. This is about patients. This is not about money. This is not about something else. This is about patients. And sadly, the costs are going up for those folks in the individual and small-group market. The access is going down, and it's only getting worse. You know the stories. Premiums increased 25 percent over the last year, on average. Arizona had an increase of 116 percent. Deductibles are going up for many, many folks. If you're a mom or a dad out there and you make $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, your deductible in this market, in that individual and small-group market, oftentimes is $8,000, $10,000, $12,000 a year. What that means is you've got an insurance card but you don't get care because you can't afford the deductible. And we know that this is happening by talking to the folks who are out there trying to provide the care. A third of the counties in the United States -- one-third of the counties in the United States have only one insurer offering coverage on the exchange. Five states only have one insurer offering coverage on the exchange. One insurer is not a choice. So we need to make certain that we correct that. In Tennessee this morning, it was announced that there are a number of counties that have no insurer offering coverage on the exchange. Insurers are leaving the market on the exchange. Last year there were 232 insurers that were providing coverage -- that were offering coverage on the exchange; now there are 167. That's a loss of about 30 percent in one year alone. And all of this means that patients are not getting the care that they need. Now, the principles that we have as our guiding star are affordability, we want a system that's affordable for everybody. Accessibility, we need a system that's accessible for everybody. A system that's of the highest quality, a system that incentivizes innovation in the healthcare system, and a system that empowers patients through both transparency and accountability. The President spoke last week, last Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, and he laid out his principles. First, wanted to make certain that those with preexisting illness and injury were not priced out of the market. Nobody ought to lose their coverage because they get a bad diagnosis. In terms of affordability, health savings accounts -- growing choices for patients is incredibly important. Tax credits that allow individuals to be able to purchase the kind of coverage that they want, not that the government forces them to buy. We've always talked about -- in terms of what kinds of reforms need to be put in place, that we need to equalize the tax treatment for the purchase of coverage. Those, again, in the employer-sponsored market, they get a tax benefit for buying health coverage. Those folks that are out there in the individual and small-group market, no tax benefit. And that's what this plan would do. State flexibility. It's incredibly important that we allow the states to be the ones that are defining what health coverage is, have the flexibility, especially in the Medicaid program, to be able to respond to their vulnerable population. Lawsuit abuse. The President mentioned, and it's incredibly important, that -- the practice of defensive medicine wastes billions and billions of dollars every single year, and we need to make certain that we're addressing that as well. The President also talked about a glide path, an appropriate transition to this new phase for healthcare for our country, and that's important as well so that nobody falls through the cracks. Buying across state lines, buying insurance across state lines. The President talked about this on the campaign over and over. The American people understand the commonsense nature of purchasing across state lines, and it increases competition. And we need to make certain that that happens, and then addressing the incredible increase in drug prices. There are three phases of this plan. One is the bill that was introduced last evening in the House of Representatives. That's the start of all of this. Second are the all the regulatory modifications and changes that can be put into place. As you all well know, the previous administration used regulations to a fare-thee-well -- in fact, there were 192 specific rules that were put out as they relate to Obamacare, over 5,000 letters of guidance and the like. And we are going to go through every single one of those and make certain that if they help patients, then we need to continue them. If they harm patients or increase costs, then obviously they need to be addressed. And then there's other legislation that will need to be addressed that can't be done through the reconciliation process. So the goal of all of this is patient-centered healthcare, where patients and families and doctors are making medical decisions, and not the federal government. We commend the House for the introduction of the bill yesterday and we look forward to working with all individuals in this process. And I look forward to a few questions. Yes, sir. Q: Mr. Secretary, you're familiar from your time in the House with the clout that conservative groups like the Club for Growth and Heritage Action have with rank-and-file members. What does it say about this legislation that these groups are already out with opposition to it? SECRETARY PRICE: Well, I think that this is the beginning of the process. And we look forward to working with them and others to make certain that, again, we come up with that process that aligns with the principles that we've defined that they actually adhere to or agree with as well, and that is that we need a system that's affordable for folks, a system that's accessible for individuals, that's of the highest quality, that incentivizes innovation, and that empowers patients. And so we look forward to working with them through this process. Q: Secretary, Congressman Chaffetz said today that Americans may need to forgo a new iPhone to pay for healthcare, and they'll have to kind of make these choices. Does the administration agree with that? Will Americans under this plan -- will they need to maybe sacrifice other goods to pay for their healthcare? SECRETARY PRICE: This is an important question, because what's happening right now is that the American people are having to sacrifice in order to purchase coverage. And, as I mentioned, many individuals can't afford the kind of coverage that they have right now. So they've got that insurance card but they don't have care. What our desire is, is to drive down the healthcare costs for everybody. And the way that you do that is to increase choices for folks, increase competition, return the regulation of healthcare where it ought to be, which is at the state level, not at the federal level. All of these things that, taken in their aggregate, will in fact decrease the costs of healthcare and health coverage, and that will allow folks to be able to purchase the coverage that they want. Yes, sir. Q: Thank you, Dr. Price. I have two questions for you. First has to do with guarantees that you can make as the administration's point person on this legislation. Can you guarantee that whatever legislation emerges and makes it to the President's desk will allow individuals, if they like their doctor they can keep their doctor? And the second guarantee is, can you also guarantee that healthcare premiums for individuals will come down with this new legislation? SECRETARY PRICE: Again, a remarkably important question because, as you'll recall, the promise from the last administration was if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor, if you like your plan you can keep your plan. Both of those promises turned out to be not true. We think it's incredibly important for the American people to be able to select the physician and the place where they're treated themselves, that the government ought not be involved in that process. And so our goal is absolutely to make certain that individuals have the opportunity to select their physician. In terms of premiums, we believe strongly that through this whole process and as it takes effect, that we'll see a decrease in not only the premiums that individuals will see, but a decrease in the cost of healthcare for folks. Remember, that was another promise that the previous administration made, that you'd see a decrease in $2,500 on average for families across this land; in fact, what they've seen is an increase of $2,500 or $3,000. So we're going to go in the other direction. We're going to go in a direction that empowers patients and holds down costs. Yes. Q: Mr. Secretary, you are quite a distance away from conservatives with this plan in the central part of it, which is tax credits, which they see as yet another entitlement, very similar to the entitlement of Obamacare but different in form. How do you convince them, since it's going to take tax credits to make this work, that they need to swallow this and move forward with the bill? I mean, you're getting an awful lot of opposition on the central tenet of this whole thing. SECRETARY PRICE: This is all about patients. And in order to provide that transition and in order to make it so that nobody falls through the cracks. We've got to have a system that allows for individuals to gain the kind of coverage that they want. And we, conservatives and others, have said for a long, long time that we believe it's important to equalize the tax treatment for those purchasing coverage, gaining coverage through their employer, and those not. And the tax credit is the opportunity to be able to equalize that tax treatment. Folks have talked about this for many, many years, actually, so that there's not a distortion in the tax code for who's able to gain a benefit for being able to purchase coverage and not. Q: Sir, Mr. Secretary, you were talking about making sure people don't fall through the cracks. The last administration, with Obamacare, focused in on making sure the underserved were part of the equation. What is the safety net or the safeguard that you have to make sure -- to ensure people don't fall through the cracks beyond the tax incentives, but also for the underserved, who are now part of -- many are now part of the program that weren't before, prior to Obamacare. SECRETARY PRICE: Yes, this is extremely important as well. And the current system, as you likely know, for those vulnerable in our population, especially in the Medicaid population, this is a system that's broken. You've got a third of the physicians in this country -- one-third of the doctors in this country that would be eligible to see Medicaid patients who aren't seeing Medicaid patients right now. And it's not because they've forgotten how to take care of patients, it's because of the rules that are in place that make it too onerous or too difficult for them to see Medicaid patients. So we believe that it's important to allow states to have that flexibility to fashion the program for their vulnerable population that actually responds to that population in a way that gives them the authority, them the choices, them the opportunity to gain coverage and the care that they believe most appropriate. Q: What if you find out that that is not happening when you give it to the states? Is there some type of punishment or some type of piece that you're going to put in place to make sure that that happens, that they follow through on your intent? SECRETARY PRICE: Yes, absolutely. There's accountability throughout the plan that we have that would allow for the Secretary and the Department to be certain that the individuals that we believe need to be cared for are being cared for in the state at the appropriate level. But we believe this is a partnership. This is about patients and partnership. The previous administration tended to make it about government. We believe it's about patients and partnership, and we want to partner with every single person in this land who wants to make certain that we allow the kind of choices and quality to exist. Q: The President tweeted earlier today. He described this bill as ""our wonderful new healthcare bill."" There's been a little bit of confusion. Does this represent the administration's bill? And is there anything in this bill that the administration cannot support? SECRETARY PRICE: This has been a work in progress. As you know, this has been going on for over a year. The work that I had the privilege of participating in when I served in the House of Representatives in the last Congress was open and transparent and we invited folks in to give their ideas. And tens, if not hundreds, of people had input into that process. This grew out of that, and over the past number of weeks, we've been having conversations with folks on the Hill, in the House and in the Senate, and other stakeholders. And so this is a work product that is a result of all of that process. The President and the administration support this step in the right -- what we believe is in the right direction, a step that repeals Obamacare and gets us moving in the direction of those principles that I outlined. Q: Do you support everything that's in that bill that's sitting on the table, sir? Do you support everything that's in the bill sitting on the table, sir? SECRETARY PRICE: This is a work in progress and we'll work with the House and the Senate in this process. As you know, it's a legislative process that occurs. I'm glad you pointed out the bill is on the table there. As you'll see, this bill right here was the bill that was introduced in 2009 and '10 by the previous administration. Notice how thick that is. Some of you will recall that I actually turned the pages and went through that piece of legislation in a YouTube. The pile on the right is the current bill. And what it means is that we are making certain that the process, that the decisions that are going to be made are not going to be made by the federal government. They're going to be made by patients and families and doctors. One last -- Q: Mr. Secretary, given the opposition that John and others have brought up here today, does this plan already need to be salvaged in your view? And how do you do it? SECRETARY PRICE: Oh, no. You know what happens with these things. You start at a starting point, people engage and they get involved in the process, sometimes to a greater degree. Nothing focuses the mind like a bill that's currently on the table and that has a -- as a work in progress -- or in process. And we'll work through it. Q: So this is a starting point here? SECRETARY PRICE: This is an important process to be had. The American people have said to their elected leaders that the Obamacare process for them gaining coverage and care is not working. That's what they've said. And so we believe it's important to respond to the American people and provide a healthcare system that allows for them to purchase the kind of coverage and care that they desire. Yes. Q: You said in your letter to the House chairman that necessary technical and appropriate changes might need to be made for this bill to reach the President's desk. So what specific changes is the White House and the administration looking for in this bill? SECRETARY PRICE: Well, as I mentioned, there are three different phases to this process. One is this bill, this legislation that's working through under the rules of reconciliation, which is a fancy term to mean that there are only certain things that you can do from a budgetary standpoint has to affect either spending or revenue. There are things that you can't do in this bill, and those we plan on doing across the horizon in phase two, which is the regulatory portion, and then in phase three, which is another piece of legislation that would be going through the House and the Senate with a majority -- supermajority in the Senate. That process will incorporate all of the kinds of things that we believe are absolutely necessary to reconstitute that individual and small-group market and to get us in a position, again, where patients and families and docs are making these decisions. Q: Mr. Secretary, bearing in mind that the CBO score isn't back yet, can you guarantee that this plan will not have a markedly negative impact on deficit or result in millions of Americans losing health insurance? SECRETARY PRICE: What I can say is that the goal and the desire I know of the individuals on the Hill is to make certain that this does not increase the cost to the federal government. Q: Mr. Secretary, two elements of the bill. I have questions about how they control costs and how they help with access. The Medicaid per-capita block grant through the states, how is that sort of fundamentally different from the Obamacare regime on Medicaid in terms of expanding access? And then the second point, why doesn't this bill do away with the cost-sharing community ratings regime that Obamacare had? SECRETARY PRICE: So the per-capita cap, Medicaid, again, is a system that doesn't work for patients. You've got folks out there who need care, who need to see particular physicians who aren't able to see them. All Americans should be saddened by the situation that we have when there are patients out there that can't get the care that they need. We believe one of the keys to providing appropriate care in the Medicaid population is allowing the states to have the flexibility to address that Medicaid population. Remember, Medicaid population is four different demographic groups. It's those who are disabled, it's those who are seniors, it's healthy moms and kids, by and large. Those are the four main demographic groups. And we, the federal government, force states, mostly, to take care of those individuals in exactly the same way. If you describe that to the folks back home on Main Street, they say, that doesn't make any sense at all. You need a program that's different for the healthy moms and kids to respond to their needs that's different than folks who are disabled and seniors. And so what we believe is appropriate is to say to the states, you know your population best. You know best how to care for your vulnerable population. We're going to watch you and make certain that you do so, but you know how to do that. And that will decrease costs markedly in the Medicaid program. We're wasting significant amounts of money -- not that folks are getting too much care, we're wasting it because it's inefficient and there's significant abuse in the system. So in terms of the cost-sharing, I think that the cost-sharing measures are being addressed. It's important that we run through that process. This is the process where we felt the previous administration was spending money that they didn't have the authority to spend, and Congress is working through that to make certain that the rightful holders of the authority to spend money in this nation, which is the Congress of the United States, exercises that authority. Q: How does the White House and you feel about the label ""Trumpcare""? SECRETARY PRICE: I'll let others provide a description for it. I prefer to call it patient care. This is about patients at the end of the day. This isn't about politicians. This isn't about insurance companies. This is about patients. And patients in this nation, especially those in the individual and small-group market, these are the folks. I had the privilege of going to Cincinnati last week with the Vice President to a small-business roundtable. And one of the business owners, one of the small-business owners there, said he had 18 employees last year at this time. This year, he has 15 employees -- not because he doesn't have the work, but because of the cost of health coverage for those individuals forced him -- forced him -- to let three people go. Now, they're being forced to let three people go because the federal government has put in place rules and regulations that make it virtually impossible for folks in the individual and small-group market to provide coverage for their employees. This is a system that's not working for people. So if we focus on the patients -- I'll call it patient care. If you focus on the patients, we'll get to the right answer. Q: Mr. Secretary, a major complaint -- sorry -- a major complaint of conservatives with phase one of the Obamacare repeal-and-replace is that it is missing a measure that would allow healthcare to be sold across state lines. Now, the President said this morning that that would be in either phase two or phase three. Is that something that you believe the President could do through executive action, and then you yourself could do? Or is that something that you believe has to be addressed legislatively? SECRETARY PRICE: There are different aspects to the purchase across state lines that will allow individuals to gain, again, the kind of choices that they want. Some of this might be able to be done from a regulatory or a rules standpoint. Some of it will require legislation, and that's where we're going to need the assistance of our friends on the other side of the aisle. The American people have demanded that they be able to purchase coverage across state lines, purchase coverage that they want for themselves. So whether it's through association health plans, which allows individuals who are in small-business groups, like the fellow that I just mentioned, to pool together nationally to be able to purchase coverage, or whether it's mom and dad, who don't gain coverage through their employer through something called individual health pools that allows folks to pool together solely for the purpose of purchasing coverage, even though they're not otherwise economically aligned. That allows people -- there are 18 million folks in that individual and small-group market. That would allow those individuals to be able to purchase coverage and get the purchasing power of millions. That's huge power and authority that we want to put in the hands of people, that we want to put in the hands of patients. And some of that may, in fact, require legislation. Yes, sir. Q: Mr. Secretary, thank you. Two questions but first, Congressman John Faso of New York has said that the issue of denying federal funds to Planned Parenthood should be separate from whatever healthcare bill finally emerges from Congress and is signed into law by the President. Is that the administration's position as well? And my second question is this. You mentioned earlier the people who had their healthcare plans cancelled when they thought they could keep it. I believe in your state of Georgia, more than a million people had that experience. Will some of the plans that were cancelled be able to come back under the new healthcare plan? SECRETARY PRICE: Yeah, in terms of Planned Parenthood, we think it's important that the legislature work its will on this process. It's incredibly important that we not violate anybody's conscience. We want to protect the conscience provisions that exist. It's also important to appreciate that through community health centers, the bill that's being proposed right now would allow greater access for women to healthcare in greater numbers of facilities across this land. And they've actually proposed more money for women's healthcare than currently exists. So I think that they're working their best to address that issue. In terms of whether or not old plans that were available before might be available, absolutely. And we believe that the opportunity to provide a robust market, robust choices for individuals across this land will be secured. And, again, that's one of the keys to bringing down the premium costs, of bringing down the cost for health coverage. So we're excited about that and look forward to that coming to pass. Q: If the new plan calls for repealing the revenue-generating taxes and penalties but keeping the entitlements, how is that sustainable? SECRETARY PRICE: That's the work that somebody mentioned over here -- the Congressional Budget Office score, and once the Congress receives that score, then they'll be working through that to make certain that in fact it is fiscally responsible. Imagine, if you would, however, a system where the incentives within the system are all to drive down costs, to provide greater choices and competition for folks, and respond to the specific needs of patients. And in so doing, what you do is actually get a much more efficient system for the provision and the delivery of healthcare. It's a system we don't have right now because the previous administration felt that the government -- the federal government ought to do all of this. And we've seen what came about when the federal government does all of that -- that it's increasing premiums, increasing deductibles, decreasing choices. You've got a card that says you've got insurance, and you walk in, and you can't afford what it is that's trying to -- for the doctor that's trying to take care of you. So this is not a system that's working for folks in that individual and small-group market and in the exchanges. Q: Mr. Secretary, many have complained that Obamacare resulted in higher wait times in the emergency room. Will this new bill cause that? Have you have any idea on that? SECRETARY PRICE: One of the things that the previous administration said was that they were going to be able to drive folks away from one of the most expensive areas for the provision of healthcare, and that is the emergency rooms. In fact, they did just the opposite. And much of that is because of, again, the rules and the regulations that they put in place. So from our perspective, we believe that if individuals are able to purchase the kind of coverage that they want, then they'll have access to the kind of doctors and other providers that they desire, and won't need to be able to be seen in the emergency room. They'll already have the care. Emergency rooms ought to be for emergencies, not for the standard care that individuals tend to receive right now. So we believe that if you put in place the right system, then emergency rooms and emergency physicians will be able to have the opportunity to care for those individuals that appropriately present to their department. Q: Mr. Secretary, I'm interested in following up on your comment that it's important that no one vote on anything that violates their conscience. Federal funding already can't be used for abortions, but are you saying that the administration has a position on provision of birth control at these community health centers? And secondly, is the administration looking to actively withhold funding to Planned Parenthood if they continue to provide abortions, as has been reported? SECRETARY PRICE: We're working through all of those issues. As you know, many of those were through the rule-making process and we're working through that. So that's not a part of this piece of legislation right here. Q: But you don't have a view on provision of birth control and access to it? When you're talking about women's healthcare, which you brought up, and saying you wanted to expand more community funding. SECRETARY PRICE: Yeah, what we're doing, as I say, is working through the rules and the regulations to see where the previous administration was, see how they did it, and whether or not it needs to be addressed. With the understanding that what we believe is important when we look at the rules and regulations is to define whether or not that rule or regulation actually helps patients and decreases costs, or harms patients and increases costs. If it does the latter, then we need to do away it. If it does the former, then we ought to accentuate it. Q: What was the issue of conscience you were talking about? What was the issue of conscience you were talking about then? SECRETARY PRICE: To make certain that individuals in the market are not forced to do things that violate their conscience. Yes, sir. Q: Secretary, thank you, sir. Common people and the small businesses have been waiting for this new bill under President Trump. So any message, sir, for them? SECRETARY PRICE: Well, I think that this is the culmination of years of work. It's the culmination of years of concern and frustration by the American people. They knew at the time that the previous bill -- the previous law passed that it wasn't going to help them. They knew that costs were going to go up. In fact, we predicted at the time that costs would go up and that access would go down. And so this is the culmination of years of hard work by the electorate, by the citizens of this country to say that we want a system, again, that respects patients and families and doctors in these decisions. One more. Q: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. The President tweeted out earlier today that he believes that he's working on a plan to have drug prices come down by spurring competition. Can you tell us a little bit about what that plan is going to be, when it might be rolled out? Is it part of these phases? And then the second question, the bill also includes a tax break for insurance executives that make more than $500,000. You said this is about patients. Why is that tax break important for this legislation? SECRETARY PRICE: To the latter, I'm not aware of that. I'll look into that. Drug pricing is really important. So many individuals are now having significant difficulty being able to afford the medications that they've been prescribed. And it's not able to be addressed specifically in this phase one because it's not a revenue or spending issue for the federal government. So it can't be in this phase one. But in phase two and three -- which may be concurrent along with this phase one -- but in phase two and three, then we look forward to bringing solutions, to solve the remarkable challenge that patients have across this line with the increase in pricing of drugs. I've got to run. You've got a guy right here who is going to answer all the rest of the questions. Thank you so much. God bless you. MR. SPICER: Thank you, Dr. Price. Let me just kind of continue on. The bottom line I think that the Secretary was making is that Obamacare sought to cover 20 million people and in the process it drove up costs for everybody, whether or not you were in the exchange or not. Most people get their insurance through their employers. Older populations get their healthcare through Medicare. Low-income populations get their healthcare through Medicaid. And veterans get their insurance through TRICARE. So what we're talking about here is a very defined amount of individuals that we're trying to address and not affect the entire system. Obamacare turned our healthcare system on its head to address the pool of individuals who don't fall into any of the buckets that I mentioned. Our plan that we're talking about today with the House will ensure that those individuals receive the care that they need if they want an affordable cost while not sending rates skyrocketing. Obamacare was an overcomplicated bill that served the special interests and not the American people. These over 974 pages that were passed and then we were told we had to read them are filled with carve-outs by over $1 billion of healthcare- related lobbying that were spent on the year that Obamacare was crafted. Our plan, in far fewer pages, 123 -- much smaller, much bigger -- so far we're at 57 for the repeal plan and 66 pages for the replacement portion. We'll undo this. And remember, half of it, 57 of those pages, are the repeal part. So when you really get down to it, our plan is 66 pages long, half of what we actually even have there. We'll undo the massive disaster and replace it with a plan to return healthcare back to the patient. As the President outlined in his joint address, he expects five core principles to guide Congress through this healthcare process. First, ensure that the American people with preexisting conditions have access to coverage. Second, ensure a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the exchanges. Third, provide more equitable tax treatment through tax credits for people who already don't receive tax-advantage healthcare from their employer. And I know -- something that Secretary Price was talking about -- for the vast number of people who get their insurance through their employer, they're getting it tax free. They are not taxed on that benefit, which is something that is not afforded to people who are in the individual market who either run a small business or are sole proprietors. Fourth, we should expand the power of health savings accounts to return control to Americans over their healthcare dollar and decisions. They should be able to choose the plan they want, not the plan that's forced on them by government. And finally, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicare to make sure that no one is left out. This is the Obamacare replacement plan that everyone has been asking for, the plan that the President ran on, and the plan that will ultimately save the system. It's also a culmination of years of dedicated work and careful thought by Republicans to find a replacement that will best undo the damage that's been caused by Obamacare while ensuring that all Americans have peace of mind during this stable transition period. These are the principles for which conservatives have been fighting for for years. President Trump looks forward to continuing the dialogue between the administration and the Hill on saving the healthcare system. What's important to remember is that we're not going to be able to do all of this on one bill. As the Secretary mentioned, there are two other steps as well that allow us to get more of the President's plan accomplished after we pass this first important, major step. The second piece is already underway, and that's what Secretary Price can do through executive action. He has already rolled out a handful of important actions, including the major marketplace stabilization regulation, to help bring stability to the collapsing insurance market. He'll continue to enact a number of policy changes in the regulatory and administration space -- administrative space to achieve what the first step cannot because of the nature of reconciliation. The third piece of executing the President's healthcare plan is on -- requires 60 votes in legislation, maybe more depending on what we can do and when. That's how we'll move forward on the policies of purchasing across state lines, lowering drug prices -- that just came up -- and repealing any of Obamacare's premium-spiking insurance market distortions that can't be done through this current bill. Also, yesterday, in addition to speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, the President also had separate calls with Prime Minister of Japan, Abe, and South Korea's Acting President Hwang. During both of these calls the President reiterated the United States' ironclad commitment to stand with Japan and South Korea in the face of the serious threat posed by North Korea. He also emphasized that the administration is taking steps to further enhance our ability to deter and defend against North Korea's ballistic missiles using a full range of the United States' military capabilities. Moving on to today's schedule. This morning, the President had a call with President Kenyatta of Kenya. We'll have a readout for that call soon, if it's not already out. The President and First Lady also announced the official reopening of public tours here at the White House. You may have seen the President stop by to surprise greet some of the first visitors on their tour. We're looking forward to welcoming the people back to -- the American people back what is affectionately referred to as the ""People's House."" We are the world's only executive residence and office of head of state that also serves as a museum free to the people. Visiting the White House is obviously an experience that's uniquely American, and we encourage guests of all ages to come visit the White House, their house. Also this morning, the Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, held a press conference announcing that Chinese ZTE Corporation has agreed to a record-high, combined criminal and civil penalty of $1.19 billion after the company illegally shipped telecommunications equipment to Iran and North Korea in violation of sanctions. This civil penalty is the largest ever imposed by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security and, pending approval from a federal judge, the combined penalties between the Commerce Department, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Treasury would be the largest fine and forfeiture ever levied by the U.S. government in such a case. This settlement tells the world that the days of flouting the U.S. sanctions regime or violating U.S. trade laws are over. President Trump is committed to ending the disrespect of American laws and American workers. So back to the schedule for a second. This morning the President also received his daily intelligence briefing. He had lunch with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who will continue to be an important partner as the President's nominee for Supreme Court, Judge Gorsuch, begins the confirmation process in the next couple weeks. At this moment, the President is leading a discussion on immigration with Senator Cotton and Senator Perdue and members of White House senior staff. The President and the senators are expected to discuss the merit-based immigration reforms that the President mentioned at last week's joint address. Later this afternoon, the President will lead a meeting with the House Deputy Whip Team focused on repeal and replace of Obamacare. There will be a pool spray at the top of that meeting. The gather time is 3:20 p.m. The President will also meet with Richard Trumka, President of the AFL-CIO. They're expected to discuss the importance of investing in our country's infrastructure and renegotiating trade agreements like NAFTA. There will also be a pool spray at the top of that meeting, and we'll have further details on it. This evening, the President will visit with a group of Boy Scouts who are in Washington to participate in a near-century-old tradition of sharing scouting's achievement with key government officials. Looking ahead, I want to let you know that the President will be welcoming at least two foreign leaders in the coming weeks, and I expect additional announcements of additional leaders later. But first, next week, Chancellor Merkel of Germany will visit the White House. And the following week, the President will welcome Prime Minister al-Abadi of Iraq. With that, I'll kick it off with your questions. Jonathan Karl. Q: Sean, it's been a full -- MR. SPICER: Jonathan. Q: Thank you. (Laughter.) Sean, it's been a full -- MR. SPICER: You're out of practice. Q: I know. (Laughter.) It's been a full three days since the President said that President Obama had his wires tapped, his phones tapped at Trump Tower. In those three days, has the White House come up with any evidence whatsoever to prove that allegation? MR. SPICER: I addressed this multiple times yesterday. I think the President -- we put out a statement on Sunday saying that we would have no further comment and we were asking the House and the Senate intelligence committees to look into this concern and report back. Q: Can't the President just ask the FBI director if this happened? Has he asked him? MR. SPICER: Look, I think -- no, the President has not. And I think that we've gone back and forth with you guys -- I think there is clearly a role that Congress can play in its oversight capabilities. They've made it very clear that they have the staff, the resources and the process. I think that's the appropriate place for this to handle. I think if we were to start to get involved you would then write stories about how we were getting involved. So it's a no-win situation. I think the smartest and most deliberative way to address this situation is to ask the House and Senate intelligence committees who are already in the process of looking into this to look into this and other leaks of classified information that are troubling to our nation's national security. So, as the President said in the statement on Sunday, we believe that that investigation, as well as the investigation of other classified leaks and other important information that threatens our national security, be looked into by the House and Senate intelligence committees, and then we encourage them to report back. Q: Do you believe that President Obama ordered something like this? MR. SPICER: I get that that's a cute question to ask. My job is to represent the President and to talk about what he's doing and what he wants. And he has made very clear what his goal is, what he would like to have happen. And so I'll just leave it at that. I think we've tried to play this game before. I'm not here to speak for myself, I'm here to speak for the President of the United States and our government. Zeke. Q: Sean, one follow-up on what Secretary Price said earlier. I think he was asked by John about whether the administration was willing to make a -- for the American people right now who like their doctor or like their health insurance plan, is the White House willing to make a commitment then today that when this replacement bill is passed, if it passes, that they will at the end of that be able to keep their doctor and keep their healthcare plan? And secondly, just changing gears radically onto -- China overnight issued some strong rhetoric promising consequences for the deployment of the THAAD missile system to South Korea. If you could respond to that. MR. SPICER: So on the first piece, I think -- look, one of the things that's important to understand about this process that's very different from when the Democrats did it -- you'll recall then-Speaker Pelosi said you're going to have to read the bill to know what's in it. I think there's a big difference. This is the bill. It's right here. It's on the website. We're going through regular order. If you go to the House of Representatives website, Speaker Paul Ryan's website, it's listed. Everybody can read it, and it's going to go through what they call regular order. We're not jamming this down anybody's throat. It's going to go through a committee process. All parties involved, all representatives in the House will be able to have input into it. I think that's the way to conduct this process, is to do it to allow people to watch the process happen in the committees, allow members of Congress to have their input in it, to make amendments, to see that we get the best bill that achieves the goal for the American people. When it was done the last time, it was jammed down people's throat, and look what happened. You had 974 pages that people struggled to read afterwards and figure out what had just gotten passed, and the consequences were, frankly, devastating. So to your point about keeping your doctor, in a lot of cases you've lost your doctor for a couple of reasons. One, they may not participate in the plan. They may not take insurance at all anymore. Two, they may not take Medicaid -- or three, they may not take Medicaid. And the list goes on and on about why they might not be there -- or your plan, the plan that you got is no longer accessible. As the Secretary mentioned, one-third of all counties in the United States no longer take Medicaid -- or, excuse me, have only one plan that you can choose from. So it's a fact right now that you -- in most cases, you have no choice. In many cases, you've lost that ability. Our goal is to actually add more choice and more competition. Right now, the government tells you, you must have this plan or you will pay a penalty, and within this plan, here's what you have to have. We've lost the element of choice and competition in healthcare, and by bringing all of that back, I think there's a higher degree of likelihood that you're going to get the plan that you want and you're going to get the doctor you want. Because it will be your choice, not the government's choice. And that's a big, big difference. This plan was jammed down everybody's throat, and the consequences took their plans away, it took their doctors away, and it drove up costs. This plan allows more competition, more people to enter it, and the American people and patients to make a decision on what plan they want. If they have a plan and a doctor they like, then they're going to choose a plan that allows them to continue with that doctor. But there's going to be more competition and more choice, not less. And that's, frankly, what you have now. With respect to China, I think I addressed this yesterday. We stand shoulder to shoulder with Japan and South Korea in doing what we can to protect that region in particular from an attack from North Korea. We understand the situation and we continue to work with them. As I've mentioned, the President spoke to both leaders yesterday. We provided a readout of those calls. But we obviously understand the concerns of China, but -- this is a national security issue for them. Hunter. Q: Thank you, Sean. How concerned is the President with the situation between North Korea and Malaysia right now? MR. SPICER: Well, as I said, I think we're very well aware of the -- what's going on in the region. The President obviously had a conversation with, in particular, the leader -- the acting President of South Korea last night with respect to what's going on there. And again, I'll refer that to the National Security Committee to give you further -- Cheryl Bolen. Q: Thanks, Sean. MR. SPICER: Cheryl. I know, sorry, I forgot you yesterday. Q: I appreciate it. So two questions. One on healthcare. If the CBO scores this bill and it does not provide the amount of coverage that the Affordable Care Act did, will the President still support it? MR. SPICER: Well, I'm not going to get ahead -- Secretary Price mentioned this -- let's not get ahead of the CBO going through this. But I think, as I mentioned to Zeke, one of the things that's important to understand there's -- this is -- this bill has to be done in the phases that it has to to address the repeal part of it, and the replace part of it. There are only certain things that we can do through reconciliation. I know there's the regulatory piece that we can do through actions that the Secretary is empowered to do, frankly, under Obamacare. And then third is an additional piece of legislation that addresses things. But there are cost-saving measures that -- and competition aspects of this that have to be included in phase two or three because they're not allowed in the reconciliation bill because of the nature of how reconciliation works on Capitol Hill. So I think that one of the things that we have to understand is that how that score comes out from the Congressional Budget Office will depend on whether they look at it specifically with just a phase one or whether they look at it in its totality. But I'm confident that if you look at what's going on right now, Cheryl, it's unsustainable. Premiums in state after state, as Dr. Price mentioned, they're up 25 percent on average. Arizona is 116 percent. I think Oklahoma is the 50s. Minnesota is in the 40s. This is unsustainable for a family to continue to pay the premiums that they have and for individuals, small-business owners, et cetera. So the question is, can we allow people to go on this trajectory where more and more of their paycheck is getting eaten up in a plan that's, frankly, not giving them choice, doctors, or plans that they want. This plan I think clearly achieves those goals a lot better. It gets the price -- cost containment down. It gets price control under it. And it allows doctors and plans to reengage in the marketplace, as they were prior to this. And I think that is a major aspect of it. Hold on. Cheryl waited. Q: Thank you. From yesterday, I had a nominations question. Is there something that's preventing the White House from submitting the nominations of Sonny Perdue for Agriculture and Alex Acosta for Labor? MR. SPICER: I believe Alex Acosta was sent up to the Hill earlier today. We should have an announcement officially out. So sometimes there's a little bit of a lag. I apologize between my office and -- but that one is up, and I'll check on Sonny Perdue. I think some of it is just in coordination with the Senate, so pardon my time. Q: Thanks, Sean. I have two questions for you. First, will the President offer a correction to his tweet this morning that states that 122 prisoners were released from Gitmo by the Obama administration and then returned to the battlefield? Can you take that first? MR. SPICER: Yes, I mean, obviously the President meant in totality the number that had been released on the battlefield -- that have been released from Gitmo since -- individuals have been released. So that is correct. Q: Then my second question. Is the White House concerned about this new information that came out in WikiLeaks today that U.S. intelligence agencies are potentially, purposely providing vulnerabilities to tech products here in the United States? MR. SPICER: I'm not going to comment on that. I think obviously that's something that has not been fully evaluated, and if it was, I would not comment from here on that. Kevin. Q: Yes, Sean, I was going to ask about branding. The President in the past put his name on buildings and different products. When it comes to healthcare, does the White House feel that the bill presented today should be known as ""Trumpcare"" from here on out? I know it was asked of the Secretary. And at what point do you think that the transition should go away from Obamacare to the new administration? MR. SPICER: Well, as soon as it's repealed we can get rid of that. I think that will happen quickly. And as Secretary Price mentioned, I think we're less concerned with labels right now and more in terms of action and results. And I think that's what our focus has been is getting that cost down, getting that choice back that we mentioned. Yeah. Q: Sean, DHS is reportedly considering separating families that cross the border illegally. How does the President feel about that? MR. SPICER: I'm going to -- that's a DHS matter. We don't get involved in either Customs or ICE enforcement. So I think that's a question better reserved to both DHS and ICE specifically. Jim. Q: Oh, thanks, Sean. On the Obamacare question, one of the criticisms on this is that there is still a de facto individual mandate because it allows insurance companies to increase premiums up to 30 percent of people -- if there's a gap in coverage. And I have one more. MR. SPICER: Well, that's not -- the difference is under the current bill that's here, if you don't buy insurance, you pay a fine. Under the current bill you don't have -- there's nothing that mandates you to buy insurance. That's up to an individual. So by its very definition, it is not -- can't be considered that. What's your second one? Q: Well, you don't think it's a de facto mandate in the sense of there's a penalty -- MR. SPICER: It can't be. Q: -- in place as there is now? Not by the government, but is by the insurance companies. MR. SPICER: Right. But there's no -- I think you answered your own question on that one. Q: I have one more. MR. SPICER: Okay. Q: Another topic. The President has blamed the Democrats in the Senate for blocking the Cabinet. Last Thursday, the Republicans actually called a recess early -- adjourned on Thursday early. Previously they called a recess the week before. Does the President have any plans to call for the Senate to remain in session and the Congress to stay in session until they approve the nominees and maybe even also repeal Obamacare? MR. SPICER: This isn't a Republican issue. I mean it's not Republicans that are playing beat the clock on a lot of these nominees. And we've discussed this since the transition time. There were several nominees that, frankly, weren't even considered controversial by the standards of Senate Democratic leadership, and yet have been held up over and over again. I don't think -- that's a very different scenario than going back and being with constituents, which was on the Senate schedule. So I don't think -- that's a synonymous thing. Do we have Michael Medved ready to go for a Skype question? Michael? Q: Yes, hello. Sean, thank you very much. Obviously, today there was a big emphasis on Obamacare, which is profoundly important to the American people. But it seems that too often in the last several weeks, the administration has gotten distracted and media have gotten distracted by talk of wiretapping at Trump Tower, or the President calling his predecessor a ""bad"" and ""sick guy"" or criticizing the ratings of ""Celebrity Apprentice."" Do you think the White House could do a better job of focusing on the issues that really matter, the reforms that matter to the American people rather than getting distracted to these subsidiary conflicts as we move forward into the coming months? MR. SPICER: Thanks, Michael. Respectfully, I would say that we have been focused. We're here talking about Obamacare and the need to drive down the cost and access for healthcare for every American. I think that's a pretty significant thing to be focused on. Yesterday, we were talking about the President's effort to continue to keep the nation safe, to make sure that people aren't coming into the country who aren't here for peaceful purposes. The President has talked to almost 50 world leaders. He's had 30-plus executive actions on all sorts of stuff from regulatory aspects to things that will create more jobs. I think that's a fairly focused effort. That being said, I think, look, whether it was Candidate Trump, President-elect Trump, or now President Trump, the President has always made it very clear -- or not he made it clear, but I think the voters made it clear that one of the things that they appreciate about him is his ability to be authentic and to speak very forcefully and very directly with the American people. And that's an aspect that I think was central to why he was elected, is because he's not a canned politician that's going to give the same staid answers over and over again. Sara. Q: Going back to Fred's question, conservatives have started to call this ""Obamacare Lite."" But President Trump has promised to fully repeal Obamacare, but this bill leaves a lot of the structure of Obamacare intact. If this is the policy that passes, is President Trump confident in the future he can say that he fully repealed Obamacare? MR. SPICER: Yeah, absolutely. As I mentioned, the first half of the bill that we put forward repeals it. There are three things, I mean -- each phase that we've talked about, phase one, phase two, and phase three, there's a repeal-and-replace aspect in each one. But Republicans and conservatives have been talking about adding competition and driving costs down for decades now, selling across state lines, small-business pooling. All of those things have been part of conservative plans for a long time. And I think instilling that competition in it, allowing more access -- I think there is a big difference. There is no -- we have for the longest time -- if you're a conservative, you think about this right now that you have -- anyone who has an employer-based -- their job comes from an employer that gives them healthcare, they're getting a subsidy. They're getting a credit. They don't pay taxes on their healthcare, and their employer doesn't either. That's a huge disadvantage to anyone who is a sole proprietor or owns a small business. And so, frankly, to allow the playing field to be leveled and allow small businesses, which are, frankly, the job creators in this country, to allow entrepreneurs and self-starters to get the same tax treatment that a Fortune 500 company gets you is a very conservative principle. And again, look, one of the things that's important, Sara, is for all of the people who have concerns about this -- especially on the right -- look at the size. This is the Democrats, this is us. You can't get any clearer in terms of this is government, this is not. And I think that part of the reason the visual is important is that when you actually look at the difference, you realize this is what big government does. It crowds out competition. It drives up prices. It stifles entrepreneurship and innovation. Doctors leaving the markets. More and more people not taking Medicaid or TRICARE. That should concern people. When you've got veterans that can't -- because most of the time, Medicaid and TRICARE are tied together. So when you have those systems not accepted by doctors, that means the lowest of our -- people on the low-income scale and people who have served our country have fewer and fewer choices. That alone should be a problem and concerning for many people. But the premium spikes are another problem. Because again, even if you're in the exchange, now you're seeing over and over again that happen. You're also seeing young people decide that they'd rather just pay a penalty because the cost of those basic programs is out of reach for a lot of young people who are just entering the job market. But again, I think the greatest illustration of the differences in the approaches is that size. Our bill, which is a tenth of the size, does repeal and replace in what their bill just did in massive government bureaucracy. And that is a big difference. Jim. Q: Just want to ask you -- I mean you had the Health and Human Services Secretary out here, you just talked about this is the Republican bill, this is the Democrat bill. Is that the President's bill? Is that his healthcare bill? Q: That is a bill that we have worked with with Congress. We feel very good about where it is. We are looking forward -- as I mentioned earlier, the President is meeting with the Whip Team to encourage them to support it and to build it out. I don't think -- and I'm not trying to be cute here -- but I think it's not his bill or their bill. It's a bill that we have worked on with them together. We're very proud of where it stands now. The big difference, Jim, is that, unlike before, as I mentioned, when the Democrats jammed it down people's throat and said -- waited to get that 60th vote, with Senator Kennedy still around, and then basically said, literally, you will have to wait and see what it looks like before we passed it -- we not only posted it out there for everybody to look at, but by sending it through regular order, not just putting it up for a House vote, but sending it through the committee process, allows Republicans, Democrats, and independents alike to offer up amendments and suggestions. And the House will work its will. Now, we will continue to give guidance and thoughts and suggestions. But I think the President's core principles are what's going to guide us as we head through the Hill and then -- the House and then to the Senate. Q: And just one quick follow-up on Jonathan Karl's question, because the President made a very serious allegation over the weekend, and I think we would all be remiss if we went through this briefing and not tried to get you on camera to at least offer us some evidence. Where is the evidence, where is the proof that President Obama bugged President Trump? MR. SPICER: Well, I answered this question yesterday on camera on your air. So just so we're clear -- I know this is now -- it will be twice. But I think I made it clear yesterday -- Q: But since yesterday, since yesterday -- MR. SPICER: Nothing has changed. Q: -- is there any new proof -- MR. SPICER: No. And it's not a question of new proof or less proof, or whatever. The answer is the same, which is that I think that there is a concern about what happened in the 2016 election. The House and Senate intelligence committees have the staff and the capabilities and the processes in place to look at this in a way that's objective. And that's where it should be done. And, frankly, if you've seen the response from -- especially on the House side, but as well as the Senate, they welcome this. And so let's let the Senate do their job and the House -- excuse me -- intelligence committees, and then report back to the American people. Q: Will the President withdraw the accusation? Does he have any -- MR. SPICER: Why would he withdraw it until it's adjudicated? That's what we're asking, is for them to look at this and see if there is -- Q: No regrets with him about raising this accusation? MR. SPICER: No. Absolutely not. And I think that what he wants them to do is to look into wiretapping, other surveillance, and again, as I mentioned before, the other leaks that are threatening our national security. You're seeing the leaks happen over and over again that come out throughout the administration, throughout government, and undermine national security. And I think the appropriate thing to do is to ask the House and the Senate to look into it. Glenn Thrush. Q: To follow up on a follow-up, in terms of -- you were given the opportunity on air to say whether or not the President still supported Director Comey. Does the President support Director Comey? And I have a quick follow-up. MR. SPICER: I have no reason to believe he doesn't. He has not suggested that to me. So now to the non-follow-up to the -- Q: Have you seen any evidence yourself? Has the evidence been shared with you or other senior members of the President's staff as to why he made this particular accusation? MR. SPICER: As far as me, no. I'm not in a position that that would be regularly part of my daily duties for the President to sit down and go through that. That's probably a level above my pay grade. But as I've mentioned, I think the President believes that the appropriate place for this to be adjudicated is for the House and Senate intelligence committees who have the clearances, the staff, the processes, to go through this, look at it and report back. Q: Did he share it with -- MR. SPICER: I'm not going to get in -- as the President made very clear, Glenn -- Q: -- with his National Security Advisor? MR. SPICER: As the President said in the statement that he issued on Sunday, we're not going to have further comment on this until this matter is resolved. Yes. Q: Two quick questions. So just to follow up on the follow-up. So does the White House feel that it's appropriate -- you say that you want it to be adjudicated by the congressional committees, but the President made declarative statements on Twitter. MR. SPICER: Right. Q: So I guess, is the White House position that the President can make declarative statements about a former President basically committing a crime and then the congressional committees should look into that and basically prove it? I mean, how does that exactly -- MR. SPICER: I take issue with -- it's not a question of ""prove it."" I think as I said, now, five times to a follow-up to a follow-up, that it's not a question of ""prove it."" It's that they have the resources and the clearances and the staff to fully and thoroughly and comprehensively investigate this and then issue a report as to what their findings are. Q: But President Trump's Twitter statement shouldn't be taken at face value about what -- MR. SPICER: Sure it should. Of course, it -- I mean, why -- no. There's nothing -- as I mentioned to Jim, it's not that he's walking anything back or regretting. He's just saying that they have the appropriate venue and capabilities to review this. Margaret. I'm sorry. Q: So on the Obamacare replacement, so you said that it will be in phases and that you're going to need additional legislation. So just to clarify, are the cost savings that you guys are projecting, is that dependent on phase three of the national competition plan? Because if that's the case then -- MR. SPICER: Yeah, well, it's not dependent. I think that in order to see it fully come to fruition, yeah, you have to see all parts of it. But the way that it was passed doesn't allow for -- the way that it was passed is almost the same way that we're going through this now, which is they pass certain things, then the Secretary of Health and Human Services, at the time, was granted significant regulatory authority that allowed her to do certain things at the time to implement pieces of Obamacare that we now have to act backwards and go almost in the same steps to do what they did to lay it out. We've got to repeal it, and then we've got to replace it with the plan that's going to do the same. Certain things can be done in the same way and certain things can't. It just -- it literally depends on how that was done. John Frederick. Q: Sean, in the replacement plan, it says that the states that accepted the Medicare expansion money would continue to be funded. So what is the message you have to Republican state legislators that thought they were fiscally responsible in rejecting Medicaid expansion in their states and now they didn't get the federal dollars on either end? What is your response to them? MR. SPICER: I think what we need to do is to make sure, as the President said in his statements, as Secretary Price did, we've got to make sure that we continue to protect people through this transition process. Let the bill work its way. But this is the first time -- as we address the Medicaid portion of this, this is probably the first time that we've really addressed an entitlement aspect of something in almost 30 years. So I think we've got to let this piece of it work its way through the House. But there is -- remember, one of the things that happened through the Medicaid expansion was the goal has always been about Medicaid to help people who were disabled or poor or met a specific number of criteria. For the first time in Obamacare, we expanded Obamacare -- or the Obama administration did, rather -- to able-bodied individuals that -- in a way that had never been done before, and it was not a specific class. That's led largely to the ballooning cost. I think a lot of the reforms that will be contained in this bill will address that, but I think we've got to let it work its will through the process. Alexis. Q: Sean, I want to ask you two communications questions on two topics. Because the President gave himself a middling grade on communication, let me ask you about the experience that the previous administration had when Obamacare was going through its own phases. The President -- President Obama said that the opposition to the legislation was able to seize the opportunity while it was being legislated to create public perceptions about what was in the legislation. So my question is on ACA. What is the President going to do to improve his communications, to be out there, explaining what is in the bill, to work with lawmakers? That's the first question. And then I'll ask you the next one. MR. SPICER: Okay, thank you. So on the first one, as I've mentioned, he's had and continues to have significant outreach to members of Congress. He's talked to health insurers. I mean, I think we've read out a lot of the activities of the last couple weeks. And literally, in just -- within an hour, he's going to sit down with the House Deputy Whip Team to talk about the legislative piece of this in the House. So this is going to be a very aggressive, laser-like focus of this administration over the next month or two to get this thing through the House and then moved over to the Senate. But there's a big difference, Alexis. What we're doing is vastly different. They were expanding government, promising people something. And I think what's happened is there was a lot of difference with how they approach it. Right now, the American people, no matter where you are, you understand the state of your healthcare, the costs that you're seeing and the lack of choice that you've now been presented with. And in many cases, you realize that when you go in to see the doctor or a loved one is going to see a doctor that they're not getting -- they're not either able to get in, they're not taking the Medicare or the exchange insurance that they got, the costs are going out of control. And I think it's really interesting -- I mean, one of the things that Dr. Price mentioned that is so apropos of this is, having a card does not mean you have insurance. It's like handing someone a blank check -- it doesn't mean that you have money, it means you have a check. And I think what we've seen over the last few years with Obamacare is you can have an insurance card, but that doesn't mean someone is going to take it, and it sure doesn't mean that it's going to be affordable. And there's a big difference between having a card and having healthcare that's affordable. And that's the difference that we're trying to solve right now. So when it comes to communication, I think one of the things that's really helpful is that part of the sell is done for us. The American people understand the state of their healthcare. They understand how much they're paying for. They've gone to see a doctor or gone to a hospital or had a notice from their carrier saying we are no longer part of this, or their employer says, hey, whatever your particular carrier is, is no longer available, we're switching you into this. And so for so many Americans, healthcare is a very, very real part of their daily experience because they're caring for themselves, they're dealing with an ailment, or dealing with children or a loved one or someone else in their family where they're seeing, firsthand, the devastation and disaster that Obamacare has caused them in their personal life. So I think there's a welcoming of this effort and I think it's a lot easier for us to go in -- because we don't have to explain the problem. People are living it. And I think for them to understand what we're giving you is more choice, greater competition. We're incentivizing more people to be part of the process, and we're going to be driving down the cost of those premiums. You had a second. Q: My second question on communications has to do with the President's assertion about the wiretapping. Because the White House wants this now to be handled by the legislative branch, and in confidence and in classification, can we count on the President to, himself, while this investigation is going on, to cease and desist using Twitter or any other public venue to make accusations that are in public but he will not respond to in public? MR. SPICER: With respect to this particular situation? I'll ask that and I'll get back to you on that. John Gizzi. Q: Thank you, Sean. Just getting back to the question about if one likes his or her healthcare, they can keep it. In 2013, Congressman Fred Upton, then Chairman of the House Energy Committee, offered legislation that put precisely those words into law and it received the votes of every Republican member in the House and between 40 and 50 Democrats, and then it died in the Senate. Would the administration support a revival of the Upton Amendment? In other words, putting the right to keep one's healthcare plan and doctor if he or she liked it, today? MR. SPICER: I mean, I think that's the goal. I don't want to start talking about what we're going to -- as we go through the process. We've now put our stamp on this and sent it to the House. It will work its will as amendments come up through regular order. Our team will weigh in on those with their staff and, again, the President is meeting with the Whip Team today. I don't want to start saying we're going to support this amendment or that amendment now, but I think generally speaking, obviously the goal is to make sure that people get a plan that they like that's affordable, that meets what they need to have met, that they shouldn't have to have a one-size-fits-all, government-instilled healthcare system that doesn't offer any choice or, frankly, isn't tailored to the needs that they have. I think that's an important thing. John. Q: Sean, right now you're two votes short of passing repeal-and-replace in the Senate because you've got four Republican senators who are saying they can't support the bill because of rolling back the Medicaid expansion. What do you say to those senators who are very concerned that people will lose coverage that this does not provide enough stability for those people who rely on Medicaid for their healthcare? MR. SPICER: Well, there's two things, John. One is, we're at day one. We're going to go through the House first, so we've got a little bit of time. And I think as we go through that process, these senators -- and not just the additional two but I think and hope that we'll get additional ones -- they recognize that those people, as I've said over and over again here -- if we do nothing, they're going to be in a very, very worse scenario than they are now. More and more people -- if you're on Medicaid, which serves so many low-income Americans, as I mentioned, they have a card. And that card does not allow them to go to doctor after doctor who are saying, we're not going to take Medicaid or TRICARE anymore. So I would ask those senators, what are you doing to help us work on a bill that will get them insured again? Because for too many Americans, they've got a card, but they don't have insurance. And I think that's a very, very big thing to -- a distinction to make. They're the ones who have the problem right now. They've got a Medicaid card and nowhere to go. And what we need to do is to make sure that low-income Americans, veterans, small business owners, individuals who desperately need healthcare have options and affordability. Q: One other piece of this. You could bring down the cost of the insurance itself through efficiencies in the system, selling across state lines. But the biggest driver of the increase in health insurance cost is the skyrocketing cost of medicine. What in this overall plan do you propose to do to either cap the rise or even bring it down? MR. SPICER: Well, I think you -- the Secretary mentioned this, but I mean, the cost of prescription drugs is -- Q: That's one small -- MR. SPICER: No, it's not. It's a big factor. I think that -- Q: But when you're paying $50,000 out of pocket to get a stent? I mean, it's -- MR. SPICER: Again, what is the biggest thing missing -- Q: -- but it's getting out of control. MR. SPICER: Fair enough, but -- Q: Fair enough, drugs is one part of it but -- huge other part of it. MR. SPICER: Okay, when you talk about procedures or drugs, the biggest thing that's missing in this whole equation is competition. I mean, we're down to one plan in many places. There's nothing for these places to compete -- Q: There's plenty of competition between hospitals. MR. SPICER: No, there's -- I mean, that's fine, but if they know they're going to get the same reimbursement rate, if they know that there's no other options, that plans aren't trying to get people -- then that's a big difference. Right now, there's a lack of competition in the industry. And I think one of the President's -- I get it may be one part of that, but you're right, that all-over medicine -- procedures and such -- there's a reason he met with drug executives and talked about getting those costs down; that there's a multi-faceted approach, and how do we instill competition, how do we drive down costs? But you're right, we've got to do more to get the cost of that down, of the procedures to allow additional options. Everything that is -- it's the same way that, again -- think about your insurance. One of the things that was driving up cost in the past was people were exercising the option of going to an emergency room over and over again for their primary care. And what happened is that you saw all of these ""clinics"" pop up from around and insurance carriers actually made it cheaper in terms of co-pays to go see that than an emergency room, driving people to somewhere that didn't continue to drive up cost, clog insurance. That competition alone starts saving the plans money and helping to keep cost down. We've got to instill more aspects of competition in medicine. Jennifer. Q: Sean, can you give us an update on the effort to roll back regulations? Have the taskforce -- regulatory reform taskforces identified any regulations to roll back? And have any actually been repealed? MR. SPICER: I think that they have had their work cut out for them. They've started as they -- the President has met with different industries and companies, corporations, associations. That is a constant subject of discussion, which is those regulatory aspects of our economy that are keeping companies from growing, expanding and hiring. And so I know that the domestic policy team and others have been working on that. And if I can get further updates on specific legislation or, excuse me, specific regulatory action, I'll get back to you. Hallie. Q: Thanks, Sean. Two topics for you. I'm trying to get some clarity on something that my colleagues have tried to follow up on as well. You've said that the President stands by his tweets Saturday morning that President Obama ordered this wiretap. You've also said that the administration wants Congress -- let me just be clear -- he found out this information. You've also said that the President wants Congress to investigate. Some members of Congress, by the way, have asked the White House and asked the President to come forward with that information. So bottom line, why would the President want Congress to investigate for information he already has? MR. SPICER: I think there's a separation-of-powers aspect here as I mentioned to Jonathan that we think it's -- Q: Talk about resources and time -- why waste that? MR. SPICER: Well, it's not a question of waste it. It's a question of appropriateness. Q: But if the President has the info, Sean -- and I guess that's what I'm trying to get to -- if he's sitting on this information that he found out, he's now directing or asking or recommending that the intelligence committees look into this. And you talked about they have resources and staff, which they do, but why expend those resources and staff if the President found out this information and has it? MR. SPICER: I think there's a difference between directing the Department of Justice, which may be involved in an ongoing investigation, and asking Congress as a separate body to look into something and add credibility to the look -- adds an element that wouldn't necessarily be there if we were directing the Department of Justice, for example. But again, I think we've made it very clear how he wants this done and where we go from there. Q: Second question then. Millions of Americans are working on their tax returns right now. Will the President commit to releasing his tax returns for this year and is he still under audit for his past returns? MR. SPICER: My understanding is he's still under audit and I'll follow up on the question. Q: Question and quick follow-up. How do you understand what we've seen on the growing number of cases at the Canadian border of Canadians born and raised in Canada with valid passports being stopped at the border and told just to go back? They won't let them come in and -- in the U.S. MR. SPICER: I'm not aware of that. I think that's something that probably should be addressed to the Department of Homeland Security. Q: Do you think there might be a misunderstanding of the messages sent on the immigration -- MR. SPICER: I don't know. I think it's a good question that is probably best directed towards the Department of Homeland Security. Dr. Swan. Q: Thank you. Is the White House going to keep its promise to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement? And our understanding is that there is some divisions of opinion -- Rex Tillerson wants to stay in; Steve Bannon wants to get out. What's going on? Will you keep the promise? If not, why not? MR. SPICER: I think that's something I'd be glad to follow up with you and everyone. I don't have anything on that right now. I'm aware of the discussion of it, so let me -- if I can, I'll get back to you Mike. Q: I have an unrelated question, but I also want to follow up on something -- MR. SPICER: Unrelated questions are my favorite. (Laughter.) Q: You talked about the communications strategy. Will the President play a public role in selling this bill? Will he speak to the public about it? Will he answer questions about it? MR. SPICER: That's a good question. I think that we are going to have a very comprehensive strategy. As I mentioned, just a few minutes from now the President is going to engage with members of the House Whip Team to talk to them. Q: -- talking to members of Congress. MR. SPICER: I understand that, but -- and I understand that. This is step one. There's a lot of time -- as I mentioned, we expect to be dealing with this for the next several weeks. There will be plenty of opportunities for the President to speak about that, to engage with the public. But it's going to be a comprehensive plan that we will discuss. We had I can't even begin to tell you how many administration folks, members of Congress flooding the broadcast and radio airwaves today, both nationally and in local markets. We were very, very active throughout the country getting out the word on what we're doing and why we're doing it, from national broadcast shows to cable to -- I mean, to radio. We had a very, very aggressive start to this effort. We're working with the House, in particular. We're continuing to start really engaging with the Senate. But this is going to be a comprehensive effort, working with the House and the Senate, to get this thing done, and other partners -- doctors and outside groups that share this concern. As I mentioned earlier to one of the other folks, there's a need by companies and corporations who are feeling the weight of additional cost to join us in this effort. And I just want -- this is obviously something that needs to get dealt with. The escalating costs are having a significant impact not just on our economy, but on the ability of people to get hired, or, frankly, people who are hired leave their job because the cost of healthcare is not allowing especially people in the small- and medium-sized businesses to keep up with those costs. With that, thank you guys very much. I look forward to seeing you -- Q: -- meeting tomorrow -- congressmen coming to the meeting with the President. MR. SPICER: We'll have a readout -- Q: Sean, I have that unrelated question, which was -- MR. SPICER: I'm sorry. That's not fair. Mike gets his unrelated question. Q: And answer mine after that, please. Q: Will the Trump administration continue the Obama administration's practice of releasing publicly the visitor logs? MR. SPICER: We're currently evaluating our procedures on that and we'll have some -- and when we have an announcement I'll let you know. And, April, I'll have a readout on our schedule for tomorrow later. Q: He's meeting tomorrow with -- MR. SPICER: Once it's confirmed, I will let you know first, and then everybody else. Thank you, guys. Have a great day. END 2:54 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-03-08,"1:37 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Good morning. First off, I want to acknowledge, as the President did this morning, that today is International Women's Day. It's also Women's History Month. We're going to be holding several events throughout the month here at the White House to honor and celebrate women and how their vital contributions have and continue to be to our society, our economy, our family and our businesses. The President tweeted this morning about the surge in hiring in the two months that he's been in office. LinkedIn's workforce reports say January and February were the strongest consecutive months for hiring in over a year and a half. A new report from ADP and Moody's showed strong private job growth that is far exceeding market expectations. And just this morning, Samsung confirmed that it's planning a ""major investment"" in U.S. production facilities, directly citing the President's election as an influence in their decision. The initial investment is expected to reach around $300 million. We keep seeing that the wave of optimism in growth in the wake of the President's pledges to help American businesses continues to produce real results for people throughout our nation. Yesterday I forgot to -- there are a couple of things that I didn't get to yesterday, so let me mention a couple of those. Yesterday afternoon, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Dr. David Shulkin, and senior White House staff met with several veteran service organizations -- included in what is commonly referred to as the Big Six -- to discuss the President's commitment to helping our veterans and modernizing our VA. The meeting represented another step in fulfilling the President's promise to the men and women who have served our nation so honorably. I know the President looks forward to personally following up on that meeting with the VSOs. Also last night, the President named several individuals whom he intends to nominate or appoint to key administration posts: Courtney Simmons Elwood, General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency; Noel Francisco, Solicitor General at the Department of Justice; Jeffrey Rosen, Deputy Secretary of Transportation; John J. Sullivan, General Counsel for the Department of Defense; Ajit Pai, member of the Federal Communications Commission; and Tony Sayegh, Jr., the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Treasury. Expect further announcements as the week goes on. Now, on to the events of the day. This morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President met with Laurene Powell Jobs, the founder and president of Emerson Collective, an organization dedicated to removing the barriers that unfortunately prevent some in the world from achieving their full potential. They discussed education and immigration policy, which are two of the areas that Emerson Collective focuses on. Then the President held a strategic affairs lunch, focused on infrastructure with leaders in the private sector. Infrastructure used to be a point of American pride. But now, an overbearing, ineffective regular system can keep projects in limbo for years. The President has already started removing the regulatory roadblocks that have been killing projects before they've even begun through his executive actions, streamlining the permitting process and calling for each agency throughout the government to identify regulations that cause undue burden. As the President has said many times, strong public-private partnerships will also be key to revitalizing our country's ruined roads, crumbling bridges and outdated airports. The government has wasted too much of the taxpayers' money on inefficient and misguided projects. By looking at infrastructure from a businessperson's perspective, as the President and these executives do, we can restore respect for the taxpayer dollar and make the best investment. The President was particularly pleased to be holding this meeting now that Secretary of Transportation Chao, EPA Administrator Pruitt, and Energy Secretary Perry are all confirmed and getting to work. In attendance at the lunch, as I mentioned, were Secretary Chao, Secretary Perry, Administrator Pruitt, and then Richard LeFrak, CEO of LeFrak; Steve Roth, the CEO of Vornado Realty Trust; Josh Harris, co-founder of Apollo Global Management; Bill Ford, the CEO of General Atlantic; Lynn Scarlett, the managing director of the Nature Conservancy; Tyler Duvall, the partner of McKinsey; and Elon Musk of SpaceX. Later this afternoon, the President will meet with Congressman Elijah Cummings to discuss rising prescription drugs prices. I know the President is looking forward to continuing the dialogue that they started a few weeks ago on the phone. At 4:00 o'clock, the President will meet with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Sullivan of Alaska. They're expected to discuss the priorities of the Department of Interior, especially as it pertains to the government-owned lands in Alaska. This evening, the President will meet with conservative leaders about health care. We'll have more details and participants on that meeting a little bit later this afternoon. The President and the Vice President continue to reiterate their support for the House bill on Obamacare repeal and replace, and look forward to working with Congress to institute a new healthcare system. Tonight, the President will have dinner with Senator and Mrs. Cruz. And finally, a couple of additional administration announcements. Today, the President and the First Lady announced the initial details for the 139th White House Easter Egg Roll taking place on Monday, April 17th. They are honored to continue the traditions of the past while creating new ones that will play a lasting role in the fabric of our nation's history. Tickets to the Easter Egg Roll are free to the public and will be allotted through an online lottery. Further details on the lottery and information on that day will be released later this month. Keep an eye on WhiteHouse.gov for updates on that. I'm also pleased to announce -- and a little bit proud -- that Taoiseach Kenny of Ireland will be visiting the White House for the traditional St. Patrick's Day visit on March 16th. We'll have further details on that visit, as well as the other foreign leader visits later this week. With that, some questions. David Smith of The Guardian. Q: Hi, Sean. Can I ask about the President's state visit to the UK? Is there timing for that? And what was your reaction to some members of Parliament in Britain saying the President is not welcome? They actually used words like ""racist"" and ""sexist."" Has that led him to reconsider? MR. SPICER: The President, as you know, accepted Her Majesty's invitation when the Prime Minister was here. He looks forward to going over and visiting the United Kingdom. As we have details to share with you further, we will, but there is nothing further at this time. Caitlin. Q: Does the White House have a reaction to the Iranian vessels coming within 150 yards of a Navy ship over the weekend? Aren't they on notice? And will you offer anything beyond a verbal reaction? And then I have a follow-up question. MR. SPICER: Okay. The USNS ship that was in close proximity is obviously something that the President has been made aware of. The President has been very clear that this provocative action is something that won't be tolerated. With that, I would refer you to the Department of Defense, who is monitoring that situation and will talk about the appropriate actions they may take. And your next one? Q: And then, secondly, does he have any plans to revamp the H-1B visa program by the April 1 deadline? MR. SPICER: I think we've talked before about immigration as a whole. I think there is the legal part of immigration and then the illegal part of immigration. The President's actions that he's taken in terms of his executive order and other revamping of immigration policy have focused on our border security, keeping our country safe, our people safe. And then, obviously, whether it's H-1B visas or the other one -- spousal visas -- other areas of student visas, I think there is a natural desire to have a full look at -- a comprehensive look at that. He discussed the RAYS Act yesterday with Senators Perdue and Cotton. We'll have more on that coming forward. But I think as the readout mentioned, he was very supportive of their efforts with respect to how we view legal immigration. He mentioned it in his joint address that we're one of only a handful of countries that doesn't use a merit-based system of immigration, and that is something that we need to look at in its totality. Hunter. Q: Thank you, Sean. I had two quick questions. Are you aware of any women who work at the White House who are participating in the strikes today? And also, more generally, what is the administration's reaction to this protest? And do you think it's an effective way -- skipping work is an effective way for women to demonstrate their power and significance? MR. SPICER: On the first part, I am not aware of any that are not here. I think everyone that I'm aware of has shown up and is working really hard to advance the President's agenda. They're committed to moving this country forward. For those of us who have joined the President throughout government, I think -- but obviously, as the President stated today, we want to recognize the contributions that women make to our businesses, to our families, to our economy, to our society. And it's a free country. People have the right to express themselves. But I think that we should, on a daily basis -- not just one day a year but 365 days a year -- appreciate the contributions that women make in all of those categories. So it shouldn't be a daily thing, and hopefully we can help fix that a little bit more. Q: Thanks a lot, Sean. There seems to be this groundswell of conservative opposition to the healthcare bill that was offered up by leadership in the House of Representatives. You mentioned the President is going to be meeting this evening with conservatives. What is his message to those individuals? Are they members of the Freedom Caucus? Will Senator Rand Paul be there? And can you give a sense about what the President intends to do to turn around that opposition that was quite apparent yesterday? MR. SPICER: So a few things on that. One, as I mentioned, we'll have a list of participants later. Two, I think that there has been a lot of -- from business and conservative groups have been very supportive of this, whether it's Americans for Tax Reform, Americans' Taxpayers Union, the Medical Device Manufacturing Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, AdvaMed, One Nation Health, Consumer Health Products Association, the Association of -- AMAC, the National Association of Wholesale Distributors, the American Legislative Exchange Council, and others. There's been tremendous support for this. We've had people throughout Washington, D.C going to different associations and groups throughout the day the last couple days talking about the benefits of this. And we're going to continue to do outreach. He met, as you know, yesterday with the House Whip team expressing his unwavering support for the bill and the process that it's about to encounter. He'll mention -- he'll work with these individuals tonight. And we're going to have a full-court press. Our team throughout the administration on local radio and local television to get that message right to the American people to talk about both the things that we talked about yesterday -- why we have a crisis right now in healthcare and why Obamacare is failing, but then secondly why the solution that the President has worked on with the House is the right one to bring down costs and to reinstitute choice. So that message is going to continue to get delivered both today and for the next several weeks until it passes the House and the Senate and comes back to his desk. But again, one of the important messages that I think those on the conservative side need to understand is, right now, there is an uneven playing field. If you get your insurance through Medicaid, Medicare, through the government, or an employer-based healthcare, you are untaxed, your employer is untaxed. It is those self-employed individuals, those small businesses that are paying the penalty for this. And that's what I think we have to remember, is that we talk so often on the conservative side and on the Republican side about the importance of entrepreneurship, the importance of small businesses to our economy, and yet they're the ones who suffer right now with an inequity in the tax system. And I think that by leveling that playing field, and by giving them more options and driving down cost, we're actually doing a very conservative thing here by removing the mandate of a government-mandated ""you must buy this program or you will pay a penalty,"" and eliminating choice. We are enacting I think very strong conservative values in healthcare that give all Americans more choice at a lower cost. So I think that should be a very positive message. John. Q: Yes, thank you. As a brand new federal employee I'm sure you're aware -- MR. SPICER: A current -- welcome back. Q: Yes, well, at the moment. I'm sure you and your family are aware that Office of Personnel Management offers a very comprehensive healthcare program called the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program. MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: You, anyone in this building, on the Hill, their staff, their family, their friends -- not their friends, their family -- well, maybe who knows -- very generous. It's state of the art. The individuals involved in the healthcare situation right now, the debate, no matter how it plays out, can they really have the kind of sympathy and empathy for individuals who may not benefit nearly as much when they're negotiating this -- all these plans, Sean? MR. SPICER: In what respect? Q: Well, I mean, you're fine. You're covered. MR. SPICER: Sure, but it's unfortunate -- first of all, I'm not fine. Because I think because of Obamacare, premiums on everybody have gone up. Regardless of what you pay, federal employees make a contribution to their healthcare plan as well. And I think that the -- all premiums have increased over the last -- whether you're in an employer-based system or not. So one of the big issues with Obamacare was in order to fix a problem that faced 15 to 20 million people, is that the entire system got shattered, and prices on everybody got ratcheted up. People who were on Medicaid suddenly lost their ability -- so the issue was, is that in an attempt to solve a problem that affected a very specified and defined group of people, we affected the entire healthcare market. So whether or not you get it from an employee or not -- an employer or not -- but to your question, that's part of the issue. Q: But -- MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on. Here's the issue -- you're right, you're absolutely right. Right now, if you're a federal employee, and a lot of cases in state, you get to open a book and you get to look at what plan matters to you, what plan is best for you or your family -- how much do you want to pay, how much coverage do you want to have, what's the co-pay you're willing to -- what services or benefits do you want as part of your plan. Absolutely. But the issue is, for so many Americans, they don't have that choice. For a third of the counties in this country, they've got one choice, one. And in a lot of states they've got none, or the exchanges are becoming fewer and fewer, the number of doctors and plans that take Medicaid, fewer and fewer. So to your point, I think actually we're in a unique place, because we get to understand what the average American should get -- that we shouldn't be limited to a specified number of people. Q: I appreciate your argument. Very well taken. MR. SPICER: Thank you. Q: However, I'm going to compare a GS-5 or a GS-9 to a senator or a secretary of one of the agencies. I mean the safety net on those individuals gives them a certain cushion, then they're negotiating. But do they really have that kind of compassion or that kind of empathy for the people who, in fact, may be thrown off the healthcare? MR. SPICER: I think that just because somebody has healthcare doesn't mean that they can't empathize with somebody who doesn't. We all have family and friends that are suffering. I mean, that's like saying because I have a job I can't be empathetic to somebody who doesn't have a job. We all have family or friends. It's the same thing when we watch a friend or a family member suffer through a terminal disease, because we have suffered through it doesn't mean that we can't have compassion towards that person or be concerned on how much that bill is costing them. I mean, that's actually in some ways -- depending on the relationship you have with that person -- you can even feel worse. You can feel guilty about how much you have and how you're not able to help that person. I think in many cases that's what drives us is to know that there are options available to some Americans and not others. Q: I appreciate your response. MR. SPICER: Thank you. John. Q: Sean, will you confirm that there is a criminal investigation into this alleged theft of cyber tools from the CIA by WikiLeaks? What can the White House tell us about the situation, particularly the fact that it seems like there's another leak for the intelligence community that's on the scale of Edward Snowden? And can you assure the American people that none of these tools have ever been used against them? MR. SPICER: Well, there's a couple things in that. Number one, for obvious reasons it is our policy as a government not to confirm the authenticity of any kind of disclosure or hack. That would be highly inappropriate for us. But all of these occurred under the last administration -- that is important. All of these alleged issues. And I think it's interesting to have it asked this way about the damage that could have occurred or what tools could be used in light of what's been going on recently. We've had your own network's correspondent James Rosen had his phones -- multiple phones tapped. Was that appropriate back then? I think there's a lot of concern out there about alleged leaks. There's two steps to this. And I think what you saw over the last week in terms of -- this should be a major concern to people in terms of the leaks that are coming out and the desire to get to the bottom of them -- whether or not -- not specifically with respect to the disclosure that you're referring to, but I think the idea that we are having these ongoing disclosures of national security and classified information should be something that everybody is outraged by in this country. This is the kind of disclosure that undermines our country, our security, and our well-being. And you've seen over the last two years, depending on the leak, it depends on the outrage. It's interesting how whenever -- whether the leak occurred under the last administration, you had member after member talking about disclosures that occurred during that last administration, whether it was members of Congress -- Elijah Cummings expressed concern during the last thing -- last administration in terms of the Americans that were -- when it dealt with Hillary Clinton, there was complete outrage about the leaks that occurred; members calling for investigations to the leaks. It's interesting how there is sort of a double standard with when the leaks occur, how much outrage there is. And so I do think it's important. While I don't want to get into confirming or denying this particular thing, I think it is interesting how different subjects are approached. This one everyone is immediately rushing to, and there should be a lot more coverage of this. This alleged leak should concern every single American in terms of the impact it has on our national security. Q: Can I ask something unrelated? MR. SPICER: Of course, you can. Q: Robin Shahini has been imprisoned in Iran since last October for collaborating with a hostile government -- that government being the United States of America. He's on a hunger strike, apparently his health is suffering. Is the President aware of Mr. Shahini's plight and that of three other Americans who are being held in Iran? And what, if anything, might the President be doing about it? MR. SPICER: Yeah, so obviously we're aware of the situation. In that particular case, I would refer you to the State Department. Q: I wanted to go back to an earlier question. What is the President personally going to be doing in order to sell this healthcare bill? And what's he going to do to convince reticent lawmakers to come along -- people like Rand Paul, who don't like it? MR. SPICER: Well, I mean, we're on day two. As I mentioned, we've been out and local -- talk radio and local markets. The President yesterday met with the House deputy whips. Today, he's having a series of additional meetings with conservative groups, with others. He's already talked to insurance agents. I mean, we've talked about the lead up to this with the insurance executives, with companies, with various members of the House and the Senate from both parties. He met with governors, attorneys general, I think there's a group of lieutenant governors coming in. We're going to be aggressively going after -- talking about the solution that we have for healthcare, both the need to repeal the current Obamacare system and the need to replace it with something that gives patients the choices and costs that they need. As I mentioned yesterday, and I can't overstate this, there's a difference between having a card and having care. Being told you have coverage and not being able to use it is no good, and that's the thing that I think is really important. When we get asked the question, so often, how many people are going to be covered, that's not the question that should be asked -- how many people are going to get the care they need? Having coverage with a high deductible and, in some cases -- or not having a plan that allows you to get the coverage you need or afford it, isn't real coverage. It's a card. And I think that's the big difference in the approach that we're taking here. It's how do we get people the affordable care they need; that there's more choice; that more doctors are coming into the system instead of leaving. And that is a big, big difference in the approach that's happening now. Q: Will he be going on the road to try to sell it? MR. SPICER: I think you will see a lot of travel and a lot of activity by the President and all of the administration. And it's not just going to be the President. It's going to be the secretary, the directors, key administration staff. The Vice President has been actively engaged in meeting on the Hill, on talk radio, on local radio, on local television. You've seen a flurry of meetings with outside interests, with op-eds explaining the problem and engaging groups and associations that have an interest in this, and industry leaders. But this is going to be a very, very aggressive, comprehensive approach to making sure that every American understands that there is a major problem and that we are here to fix it. Cecilia. Q: Just on WikiLeaks, I want to go back to that -- two parts. Is the President outraged by this? MR. SPICER: Well, I mean, again, I don't want to -- the allegations -- he has been very clear about the concern that he has for leaks. This is -- Q: This one specifically -- MR. SPICER: Well, again, Cecilia, if I -- I think he is very concerned about the allegations that are out there in terms of what may or may not happen. It is an allegation, it is something that we are not going to confirm at this time. But as you can imagine from the President's previous comments, he is extremely concerned about this, about these allegations, about this -- about the potential that something -- if this were true -- would have on our national security. And make no mistake about it, I think the President has talked before that anybody who leaks classified information will be held to the highest degree of law. We will go after people who leak classified information. We will prosecute them to the full extent of the law. Playing with our nation's national security is not something that should be taken lightly under this administration. Q: Quick follow-up. When it came to the campaign and Hillary Clinton, the President said, ""I love WikiLeaks."" Does he still feel that way today? MR. SPICER: There is a big difference between disclosing Podesta -- John Podesta's gmail accounts about a back and forth, and his undermining of Hillary Clinton, and his thoughts on her on a personal nature, and the leaking of classified information. There is a massive, massive difference between those two things. And I think it is, again, the interest and the outrage that occurred last year by a lot of Democrats when it came to leaks is interesting that we're hearing not as much outrage now when it comes to some of our issues of national security. April. Q: Sean, a couple questions. One, you said Congressman Cummings -- you affirmed Congressman Cummings is meeting with President Trump today. MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: In the last press conference, his solo press conference the President had, he talked about Senator Schumer telling Elijah Cummings not to come. What happened to smooth this over? And what is the conversation going to be about? Is it just going to solely be on the high cost of prescription drugs? MR. SPICER: Well, I think that the nature of the meeting stems from the conversation they had on the phone, which was on prescription drugs. And then I'm sure that if Congressman Cummings or the President brings up another subject, it will go there. I'm not -- we'll try to have some sort of readout afterwards, depending on how that goes. But the nature of it is an area where they agree. And if you remember, one of the things that they talked about on the phone was that there were probably several more areas that they would agree on, and find that they would agree on, throughout a conversation. And I hope that that conversation does exactly what they said that it would in terms of getting to those areas of common agreement where they can work together to help solve additional problems that our country faces. Q: So you don't have any knowledge of what happened to smooth that over for him to come in -- MR. SPICER: I know our teams were in touch with -- his office immediately followed. And as you know, there were a couple times when the meetings had been -- tried to be scheduled and just didn't work out. And luckily, he was able to -- Q: He's one member of the 49 of the CBC. Right after that press conference, the White House reached out to the Congressional Black Caucus, to Cedric Richmond, the head of the caucus. Where is that meeting? Where does that meeting land? Is it happening? MR. SPICER: I know that we've reached out, and we're looking for a date on that, as well. So we're pleased that this one was able to come together, and then we'll get to the next one. Q: My last question. MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: Yesterday there was a compare-and-contrast with visuals, show and tell if you will -- MR. SPICER: Yes, I saw that -- Q: Yes, you were -- yes. And you compared and contrasted about how you're going about it and how the Obama administration went about Obamacare. One difference that they've made note of -- and I want to get your response to this -- is the fact that you may have this and said that you're doing this versus what they're doing -- the one thing they say that you did not do that they did: had their bill scored by CBO. And you did not score it by CBO. MR. SPICER: Sure. It is being scored. Look, I know -- look, with all due respect to them, this the same group that said -- who passed it and then told us we could read it. This bill is online for every American to go to ReadTheBill.gop. It's on the Speaker's website. We link to it on several accounts that we've tweeted. Q: But it was scored before they went before the Congress. MR. SPICER: I understand that. And again, if that's the complaint, this is the same group that didn't let anybody read it, that jammed it through with no bipartisan support. This President has reached out to both sides of the aisle, had governors here, had senators here to get their input. There is no contrast between what we did and what they did. This was a full effort to reach out to the members in the House and the Senate. It's going through regular order in the House. Every member of the House and the Senate will be able to have their opportunity to have amendments offered through -- well, through the committee process and on the floor. So the idea that they can compare the date that they got it scored is pretty reaching deep on this because there has been an opportunity for members to have their input on this and to talk about their concerns, to give their input on it -- especially the governors, who were left on the sideline last time and who have such an important role in administering healthcare when it comes to Medicaid. The idea that anyone talks about when the score was issued -- there will be a score in all good time. But the other thing is, let's be honest, the irony of the score is that the CBO was way off the last time. I don't think that we're waiting to -- that that's a big issue to us right now. Q: Doesn't cost matter, though, before you -- MR. SPICER: Of course, cost matters. But look at how off they were last time. If you're looking at the CBO for accuracy, you're looking in the wrong place. They were way, way off last time in every aspect of how they scored and projected Obamacare in terms of -- Q: But you have no numbers -- MR. SPICER: But neither did they. Last time, if you look at the number of people that they projected would be on Obamacare, they are off by millions. So the idea that we're waiting for a score -- it will be scored. But the idea that that's any kind of authority based on the track record that occurred last time is a little far-fetched. Jessica. Q: Two questions on the wall, Sean. As you know, the bids for prototypes went out today. And I just was curious about the timing of that, how much pressure there was to get that going quickly. And then secondly, is there guidance from the White House about what kinds of vendors can build the wall, especially can international vendors build the wall? MR. SPICER: I think that process is working through -- as the President has talked about before, we were trying to move ahead with existing funds that DHS has. And then we'll continue to create a timeline to ask Congress for that funding. We're working with Congress on that. And then I don't think it will be any surprise to know that the President is going to favor American workers and American companies when it comes to an American project. That shouldn't be any kind of surprise. Blake. Q: Sean, it's looking increasing likely that the Federal Reserve next week will hike interest rates. Two brief questions. One, how does the President feel about that? And secondly, does he have the full confidence in Janet Yellen, who he described during the campaign as ""too political"" to lead the Federal Reserve and set monetary policy? MR. SPICER: Let me get back to you on that one. I don't have any comment on the Federal Reserve. I'll look at the team. What I will say is that, as I mentioned at the outset, when you look at the hiring and the jobs and the manufacturing and the pace, the consumer confidence and the CEO indexes that are going -- that have already come out in the first two months, we see a resurgence, an optimism in the economy by job creators to want to hire here, who want to manufacture here, who want to grow here. And I think that our economy is clearly on the upswing. And I think you see statement after statement, company after company coming out and sharing in the President's vision for moving the country forward and for renewing the optimism and building and being part of an American resurgence in terms of our economy. Q: Just to be clear, the no comment was on Mrs. Yellen or on this thoughts of a rate hike? MR. SPICER: I'll get back to you on both. How is that? Yeah, go ahead. Q: Sean, along with April's last question about the difference between this administration and the previous one and how to approach this issue, one thing that the Obama administration did do was get key stakeholders at the table -- AARP, American Medical Association. Both of those organizations have come out today strongly opposed to this proposal. What's your message, particularly with respect to the AARP? MR. SPICER: Well, they got a really good deal last time when it came to prescription drugs in particular. I think -- this is a patient-centric bill. It's about patients. It's about people. It's about the Americans who were left behind. Look at what those deals got people last time. I mean, for all those people that are on Medicaid, in particular, they don't have choices anymore. So I would argue that the President has put the American people first and has put patients first. So you can talk about -- we're glad to have support, make no mistake about it. But I think that the support that this administration and I think the House is focused on is getting every American their buy-in and their support. Obviously, look, I'm not going to -- we would love to have every group on board. But this isn't going to be -- every single deal we heard about it getting through, ""the Cornhusker Kickback,"" this and that. Over and over again, it was one deal after another to get to -- to buy votes to get it through the Senate. So if you want line up how many special interests got paid off last time versus now, they'll probably win hands down. Q: Sean -- MR. SPICER: This isn't -- hold on -- but this isn't about trying to figure out how many special interests in Washington we can get paid off. It's about making sure that patients get the best deal that lowers prices and brings back costs. But again, I think -- what I'm trying to figure out is at some point you're defending the indefensible. Nancy Pelosi put out three criteria for how they judge Obamacare. And by their own standards, they fail on all three. Costs are up. Choices are down. There is no other way to judge that. By every account, every single premium by every standard is up. Choices are down across the country. So there is a horrible deal that the American people got bought -- got sold. And what we're trying to do is put patients back first in line. Q: But so the AARP is specifically talking about patients in their 50s and 60s. The AARP describes this as an ""age tax"" that will disproportionately affect people who right now are low-income, are benefitting from subsidies under Obamacare and could stand -- according to the AARP's estimate -- to take a hit of thousands of dollars in their premium payments this year when the subsidies go away and the tax credits go away. What's your message to those people who voted for the President? MR. SPICER: I think that -- right. And the message from the President is that we want you to get more choice and a lower cost. And I think that, as we work this bill through, through daylight -- not jam it through in the middle of the night -- that they are going to see as more and more people will that this is a deal for the American people that's going to put patients first, lower their costs, and give them more choices. But again, I don't -- there is probably not a person out there, either through themselves or a loved one or a friend or a colleague that has seen choices go down and premiums go up [sic]. So what people are dealing with now is not acceptable. And I think the idea that anyone defending the current status quo -- and even in some of the statements of some of the groups, they admit that there's a problem right now. And so my advice to those people is, join the process. Share your idea, share your thought, let the process work its will so that it is a bill that has input. But the bill -- the way it was done last time is not something that's acceptable. Shannon. Q: Is the President worried, though, that every major doctors group -- the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians -- have all come out and said they have serious concerns? For all the talk of doctors and patients and choice, the doctors groups are all so far unanimously coming and saying they're not supportive of this. Is that concerning to the President? MR. SPICER: No, I think when you look at a lot of doctors versus the associations here in Washington, we have had tremendous input from doctors themselves. Dr. Price, himself a doctor, is the one who crafted this. So you have a doctor in charge of the administration's effort to work with Congress. You've got several physicians and other medical professionals in Congress that are talking about the experiences they have -- in fact, many of them ran for Congress because of the concerns they saw in their own industry. So while I have respect for some of the work that some of these Washington, D.C.-based associations do, at the end of the day this is about patients and about the input from doctors who are on the front line of seeing patients and talking about the care that they're able to give or not to give to people. Anita. Q: Do you mind if I follow up on something else you said? MR. SPICER: I do -- I don't, sorry. Q: You've talked about people having a card. You've got a card, but it's a $2,000 deductible and there's only 10 doctors in your town that will see you, let's say. But that's better than nothing if you get cancer or hit by a car. So maybe this makes access -- right, but it is better than no insurance. So if this expands access to people and choice, but it reduces the number of people who actually have health insurance -- MR. SPICER: But I don't think -- Q: -- so can it do both? MR. SPICER: Yeah, of course it can. And it will do both, by ensuring that more people -- right now you've got more people paying the penalty and saying, I don't want healthcare, I'm going to pay the penalty because costs are too high. And was it probably five, six, seven years ago, before Obamacare went into place, a single individual, young individual person on the open market could get a premium -- a plan with a premium of 100, 150 bucks a month. It's in the high 300s now. And I think that there's a big difference. You're not -- for young people just entering the workplace, for example, your example -- they go get into an accident, right now you've got a lot of individuals that get off their parents' healthcare and say, I'm healthy, I have no desire to go get healthcare, it's another few hundred dollars a month that I don't have or that I'd rather spend on something else. If we can get that cost down, it makes a lot more sense -- and get them plans that are tailored to them, 27-, 28-year-old individuals don't need care that's for folks -- that talks about certain things that -- a plan that has certain things that are towards the end of life. But right now, you've got one-size-fits-all, government-run, government-mandated plans that offer people a suite of medical services that they do not need, because there's no choice, and it's a government-mandated system. I think offering more choice and more competition allows people to pick a plan that is more tailored to your needs. And this goes back a second ago to what John was asking, that if you can actually pick a plan and across state lines find one that suits you as an individual -- as opposed to maybe there's a family plan that's more comprehensive, it has dental and vision and all the things that your kids are going to need because of all the things you anticipate -- that's a plan that a young family might need versus an older person that's single or a young person that's just entering the workforce. But right now there's no competition, there's no choice. So it's not an either/or situation. We're facing a situation where more and more people are getting less and less and paying more and more for it, and that's the wrong way to go. Mara. Q: Anita. You actually -- Anita. MR. SPICER: My apologies. Anita, then Mara. Q: Switching gears completely, the military have recently conducted some kind of exercise at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, and it was preparing for a migrant crisis. And there is a DHS migrant center there. And I wondered if the administration has considered, and what you all think about using that facility for immigrants. Has that come up? MR. SPICER: That particular exercise, to the best of my knowledge, is a rather regular exercise that occurs, as do many of the exercises that the military prepares for on a whole host of contingency operations. So that is a routine military operation. Q: Is there any consideration, though? MR. SPICER: It is a routine military operation, as several of them do with our partners throughout the world where we plan for random contingencies that may or may not happen. That's the job of the military -- to practice for contingencies that may or may not happen on a whole host of issues. But to try to ascertain -- Q: Okay, so are you all considering using the facility for immigrants? MR. SPICER: There is nothing to consider it for. I think we're fine right now. There is nothing that we would need to use it for. But again, I mean, I think part of the goal of preparing the military going through various exercises is on a whole host of issues -- on refugees, they prepare for natural disasters. We're not anticipating a natural disaster, but we prepare for them. At the White House, when we were coming in as an administration, I think we briefed during the transition period -- we did what's called a right-seat, left-seat operation with the outgoing administration. So we sat down and talked about cyberattacks and natural disasters, and the whole-of-government response in some of these things. It doesn't mean that we anticipate them, it doesn't mean that we want them, it means that we're going to prepare for them in the same way that many organizations do fire drills. It's not that you anticipate or expect a fire, but you prepare for them, as many families do. Preparedness is the key to executing well, and I think that's what all we're doing. Q: And secondarily, the Louisville media is reporting that President Trump will be there on Saturday. Can you confirm that? And is this about healthcare? As you just said, he was going to make the rounds. MR. SPICER: Yeah, I've seen that report. We have nothing to announce with respect to the President's schedule at this time. But, as I mentioned earlier to I think it was Shannon, that we will have -- or is it Jill, I can't -- somewhere in this area -- we will have an update on the President's schedule later this week. But I do anticipate the President to be very active in his support for the repeal-and-replace effort. And so this is what you should expect. Now Mara. Q: The CBO score is supposed to come out next week, and you just called into question their credibility. MR. SPICER: I didn't call into question -- just so we're clear, I'm just -- Q: It's true. MR. SPICER: Thanks, Matt, I appreciate it, I can answer. Their record is what I'm calling into question to -- when you look at the number of people and the costs on what they scored, the last Obamacare bill on, it's way off. That's a fact, that's not anything more than that. Q: Well, people base their votes on what they think is going to happen to the cost and the coverage -- if they lose coverage. MR. SPICER: That's right. Q: Is there any analytic organization that you would accept a score from? MR. SPICER: Well, I think that there's -- yeah, I mean OMB will probably put out a score on -- Q: If not the CBO, is there some organization -- so OMB is the -- MR. SPICER: No, no, I'm not saying -- but, Mara, hold on. All I'm saying is, look at what the CBO's record is on Obamacare. It's vastly off. I think they projected 20 million people to be on Obamacare this year; I believe the number is 12. They're way off in terms of the millions. So it's not a question of whether I'm questioning anything -- anyone that can actually do basic math can understand that their projections for Obamacare the last time were way, way off the mark. And so my only point is, is that I think when they come out with this score, we need to understand the track record when it comes to healthcare. Q: -- the track record? Is there any scoring organization that you think has a good track record? MR. SPICER: There's probably a lot. And I think members have to look at a lot of things to cast their vote on. They're going to have to look at the totality of the bill, the support of their constituents, the current state of things. I think that there's no question -- look, when you look at the trajectory of the cost right now in terms of premiums, you can either say -- and not just the premiums, but Obamacare is going to collapse on its own weight very soon. And the President made it very clear in his press conference and a lot of previous statements, the politically easy thing to do is just let it collapse and let Democrats come back to the table. I don't think that's the right thing, and the President has made it clear he doesn't think that's the right thing. This is an opportunity for him to show the American people that the right thing to do is to care about their healthcare options and the cost that they're paying. Q: And just one last thing. He mentioned deductibles before and how they're going up under Obamacare. Are you promising people that their deductibles will come down under this plan? MR. SPICER: Everything that we have been led to believe about how this is -- yes, this will drive costs down. When you talk about opening up pooling, when you talk about driving costs down because you can buy it over state lines, everything that has driven up costs, all of those market forces that will come in, and I think every leading economist that has looked at this says it will drive costs down. John Gizzi. Q: Thank you, Sean. The premier argument by Democrats, notably former President Obama today, is that enactment of the act that was illustrated yesterday would lead to many people losing their healthcare. You certainly heard that from Democrats, but also several of the Republican governors who were here for the National Governors Association, including strong allies of the President -- Governor Bentley of Alabama, Governor Hutchinson of Arkansas voiced the same concern. They did not want any plan that would lead to anyone losing their present healthcare. What does the administration say to what is the leading argument against a new plan? And then I have a follow-up question. MR. SPICER: Of course. I would say that any governor that is concerned about people losing care right now should join us. They are losing their care right now, they are losing their options, and they are paying too much. So the answer is that, if you're concerned about those principles, then you should be concerned with what is happening right now, and you should be concerned and want to join in this administration and work with this Congress. And again, the big difference that's here is, instead of us jamming a bill down Congress, and now allowing the American people to read it until it is passed, as was done with Obamacare with then-Speaker Pelosi, is that this bill is out in the open for every single person in the world to read. It is open for people to let their member of Congress share their thoughts, share their ideas, and it's done out in the open. I think that is a vastly different approach with how this is going about than the last time, and that makes a big difference with the approach. And it gives people an opportunity through the process, what they call regular order, to have input on this. And if it can be made better, then great. But I think this time, we recognized that there's a lot of work that needs to get done on behalf of the patients that are having trouble getting care. Alexis. Q: Oh, wait. MR. SPICER: I'm sorry. Q: My follow-up question is a follow-up question about the wall. During the recent Governors Association meeting, Governor Graco Ramirez, who is the Chairman of Mexico's Association of Federated Governors, warned that continued discussion about the wall and the President's talk of building it might very well lead to the election of Mr. Lopez Obrador as the President of Mexico, and he is considered the most anti-American, most hostile-to-America of any of the candidates. Are there any concerns that come up in the discussion of the wall, namely the impact on Mexican politics? MR. SPICER: No. (Laughter.) That was pretty good. The President's number-one concern is the safety of our country. Number two is the jobs that are impacted by this and the ability of Americans to get the wage that they deserve. But again, this is a national security issue, something that, frankly, when he's discussed this with President Pe—Åa Nieto of Mexico, that -- there is a shared concern about drug cartels, drug trafficking, arms sales over the border. There is a shared concern for the respect of the border, because it means a lot to both sides. So this is something that we care about from a national security standpoint, and then obviously the President is concerned on it both -- as well as on an economic standpoint. Alexis. Q: I want to follow up on what John was just -- your answer was that if the healthcare bill could be made better, the President is interested in that. So could I just clarify, when he meets with the congressional conservatives this evening who have misgivings about the legislation, is he intending to talk to them about what they would like to change, and is he open to making those changes? Is that what he -- is that the mode he's in, rather than a sell mode? He's in a listening mode? MR. SPICER: I think he's in a -- very much of a sell mode. The President and his team have worked very hard on this. They're very proud of the effort and the product that they have produced in consultation with the House and the Senate. But obviously, it's going through the process. And so if somebody has an idea -- and that could be on the administration's side -- that we believe that after a consultation with individuals or groups, that there's a way to improve upon this -- but that's the beauty of going through the process that we are. But make no mistake, the President is very proud of the product that we have produced. We are out in full sell mode all around the country talking about how we think this is the best way to solve the problem that the American people face, and why we believe that the solutions that we put forward in this bill are the right ones, and that will benefit them. Go ahead. Q: And can I follow up and say -- before the President meets with Chancellor Merkel next week, is it possible that we could see the President for a more general multi-question news conference? He's been a little press-shy this week. And from North Korea to healthcare selling to CIA leaks, we'd love to talk to him. Could we see him for a news conference? MR. SPICER: I will ask, Alexis. (Laughter.) Q: Would you ask him that? (Laughter.) MR. SPICER: Is there anyone else? I would be glad to ask -- show of hands. (Laughter.) Okay, thank you, I appreciate it. I would be glad to ask the President, share your request with him, and I'll see what we can do on his schedule. But as you can -- he is very busy these days. He has done a lot of sprays, he will continue to interact with you guys. But I will be glad to make your request known. Katie. Q: Sean, yesterday Secretary Price said that the bill that you guys have introduced, both the repeal and the replace, are starting points. And on Capitol Hill there was a lot of talk of the starting point being a nonstarter. So it seems like there's negotiations that need to be made. Does the President have any non-negotiables in his bill that he will not take out, even at the request of conservatives? MR. SPICER: Well, Katie, I mean, I think, as I was just saying to Alexis, that it is a starting point. It's going through regular order in the House. And so part of that process as it goes through the committee markup hearing, both in Ways and Means and House Energy and Commerce Committee -- that by its very nature allows for input through both of those committees and then ultimately on the floor before it moves over to the Senate, and the Senate goes through a similar process. So I think, frankly, we're just acknowledging the reality of where the process is. But we're proud of the process, we're proud of the input that we've received from governors, from senators, from individuals, associations, companies. And we feel very proud of the work that is encapsulated in this bill, and the results that it will yield. And so that being said, I think the President understands, as a businessman, that if someone's got a really good idea that he's going to listen to it. And if he can be part of the process to help make something better, there's nothing that's going to preclude that. We have been very open to listening to people. We're very proud of that. We're going to go out, as I said, in full sell mode. But if there's an idea that comes across, we're going to entertain that to make it clear. Hallie. Q: Sean, two topics here. First on healthcare, then I'll have a follow-up on that. In the past, you and others have accused Democrats of rushing through the original healthcare law. Now, there are some Republicans, including today, who say this is simply moving too fast. Is the President willing to accept a delayed timeline if it pushes repeal and replace into later in the year? MR. SPICER: Going through the process can't be delayed -- I mean, by its very nature. We're going through the committee process. There are two House committees -- Q: But you said the timeline is being -- maybe Easter break -- after that -- MR. SPICER: But again, that's subject -- right, but again, I would argue it's subject to how the House does its will and then how the Senate does. I think obviously we would like this to move forward. There's a lot of stuff in the queue. We've talked about tax reform. This bill is attached to the FY17 budget reconciliation, and I know that, for a lot of Americans, that means nothing in terms of the phrase and the nomenclature that surrounds how Congress does it. But it's important to recognize that that vehicle allows Congress to do certain things and not others with a 50-vote -- with a majority vote in the Senate. That's important. There are certain things you can do through that, that you can't do through other vehicles, and that will take a 60 vote and -- that you can do administratively. So it's actually -- if you heard Dr. Price talk yesterday about the three phases, it's actually multi-phased, it's going through regular order. But there is simply no contrast between how we are approaching this and how Democrats approached it last time. Number one, there's actually been input from across the aisle, both from the governors who were here, attorneys general, outside groups, House and Senate Democrats have been able to provide input to both staff, to the senior administration officials and to the President. And then secondly, it's actually going through the process. So while we can predict a timeline, ultimately, it's going to be up to the House and then the Senate to determine how fast it goes. But there are members on each of those committees, and then, ultimately, every member on the floor that has the ability to give input. Q: Just one other question. I'm just curious about this meeting with Senator Cruz tonight. He has come out and expressed some skepticism on the bill as it stands now. Presumably that will be part of the topic of conversation, but as you mentioned, Heidi Cruz is coming too, and I'm wondering if the President has any plans to apologize to her for the insinuations he made on the campaign trail. MR. SPICER: I think they're looking forward to a great dinner. He had dinner with the Rubios a couple of days ago, maybe a week ago. He had lunch yesterday with Senator Graham. As I stated weeks ago, the President is going to continue to have outreach to members of Congress of both parties. He's meeting with Congressman Cummings today. This is a President who wants to engage with members of both sides of the aisle in both Houses, but also groups, business leaders, union leaders, the AFL-CIO head, Richard Trumka, was here yesterday. This is a President that's going to engage with everybody that can help join in proposing ideas and thoughts and opinions on how to move the country forward. So he looks forward to dinner tonight with Senator and Mrs. Cruz, as he has with several others. And I think you're going to see more -- a continuation of this kind of effort to reach out and get people's ideas. Margaret. Q: And then -- I apologize, I have a second topic, which is, does the President believe the CIA has been compromised in any way? MR. SPICER: With respect to the disclosure, is that what you're -- Q: yeah. MR. SPICER: Again, I'm not going to -- it's U.S. government policy not to confirm this. I think he has obviously been very concerned, as I stated, about the disclosure of national security on any level. It undermines our country's national security. And I think that -- I just will say, I think there's also been a big double standard when it comes to disclosures of classified information and the outrage that exists when one side has it happens versus another. Q: What do you mean? MR. SPICER: Well, I think that there has been a lot of disclosures about national security that occurred last cycle when there was potential that the FBI had leaked certain information. The members of Congress on the other side of the aisle, Hillary Clinton, and others talked about how there was so much concern about classified information -- we're seeing such silence and outrage from the media, from others with the current disclosures now with things that may or may not have happened towards the 2016 election when it comes to this side. So I think there's a vast difference when it comes to how the disclosures are approached. Yeah. Q: Sean, on North Korea, what is President Trump's position toward North Korea, and what is his decision for the North Korean policy? MR. SPICER: On the which -- Q: North Korean policy. MR. SPICER: On the politics? Q: No, policy. Q: Policies. MR. SPICER: Oh, policies. Well, I mean, we're very troubled by the launch of missiles that have occurred from North Korea. I think that's why the THAAD missile system that we've started to deploy into South Korea is so important. We're continuing to work with the government of South Korea to make sure that they have the defenses necessary to protect themselves. The deployment of a THAAD system is critical to their protection, as witnessed by this weekend's ballistic missile test. China and the United States in particular both understand the threat that North Korea poses to the region. And I think that there's areas of concern that we can work together to protect the country. Trey. Q: You had called on me. Q: Today was International Women's Day. There's a lot of concern about access to healthcare for women. Will the President commit to reaching out to female Democratic lawmakers as the next two phases of this healthcare bill continue? And additionally, what is the President's stance on access to birth control for women across the country? MR. SPICER: I think that question was asked and answered by Secretary Price yesterday. With respect to women's health, the President has also made it clear that he intends to have a substantial increase in funding towards women community centers that fund women's health services. And that will be reflected in his budget. Margaret. Q: Thank you. MR. SPICER: Sorry. Q: Sean, is the President the target of a counter-intelligence investigation? MR. SPICER: I think that's what we need to find out. There's obviously a lot of concern. I mean, I mentioned to John there was considerable concern last cycle when a reporter was the target of one. But part of the reason that we have asked the House and the Senate to look into this is because of that. And I think it was interesting. I think if you look at last week, all of a sudden these stories that keep coming out about the President and his links to Russia, it has continued to be the same old, same old, played over and over again. The President has made clear he has no interest in Russia, and yet a lot of these stories that come out with respect to that are, frankly, fake. They are a series of fake allegations that at the bottom note, ""While there's no evidence to substantiate any of this,"" it's the same unnamed sources, ""associates"" that we get tagged with, and yet there is no evidence that continues to be shown. And every single person that gets briefed on this shows that -- whether it's Senator Cotton, Chairman Nunes, who has done a phenomenal job of trying to get to the bottom of this. But it's interesting, I think the double standard that exists between the concern about getting to the bottom of the allegations that -- with respect to the President, that there are so many other issues. When you talk about -- Q: So he doesn't know whether he is the target of a probing? MR. SPICER: But I think that's one of the issues that we have asked the Senate and House to look into. I can tell you with respect to the other instances, you look at former DNI Clapper's comments, he literally said, the DNI -- he said, ""The DNI, which includes the NSA, FBI and CIA, did not find any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian agents."" Senators Rubio, Cotton, Burr, Chairman Nunes -- all of the people who have been briefed on this situation have come to the same conclusion. And it is interesting how many times this fake narrative gets repeated over and over and over again, and yet no evidence has ever been suggested that shows the President has anything to do with any of the things that are written. It's a recycled story over and over and over again. And I think that there's a bit of -- it's amazing, the President goes out last week, does this joint session, and then literally 24 hours, stories start getting recycled about potential issues that come up that literally continue to offer no fact, nothing but the unsubstantiated rumors over and over again. And yet, what is ignored is when you have someone like former DNI Clapper go out and literally say that they ""did not find any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and [Russian] agents."" You have Rubio, Cotton, Nunes all say the same thing that they've been briefed that there's nothing -- and yet this fake narrative -- Q: Sorry, just want to make sure that I'm understanding you. Are you saying that there is a possibility he is the target of a counter-intelligence probe involving Russia? Because you just connected those two things. MR. SPICER: No, no, no. I think what I'm saying is that there is a difference between that narrative and then the narrative that has been perpetuated over and over again. The concern that the President has and why he asked the Senate and House intelligence committees to look into this is to get to the bottom of what may or may not have occurred during the 2016 election. But the interesting -- Margaret, is that when you look at every single person that's been briefed, they've all come to the same conclusion -- that nothing happened during the 2016 election tying him to Russia. And yet the fake narrative continues over and over and over again, and the idea that it has to -- it continues to be recycled without any substance, without any evidence, needs to stop. Yes. Q: The President said he was tapped. Q: He said his wires were tapped. Q: He said this as a fact. MR. SPICER: I understand that, and that's why we're -- Q: So you're saying he doesn't know whether he was wiretapped? MR. SPICER: No, no, no, that's not what I said was -- Q: Well, he doesn't know he's the target of an investigation. Q: That his wires were tapped. MR. SPICER: Hold on, one at a time. I said that the President made clear on Sunday that he has asked the House and the Senate intelligence committees to use their resources and their processes to examine the facts and come to a conclusion. Chris. Q: Since you're talking about whether things are true or not, let me ask you -- following up on something yesterday, you seemed to acknowledge that the President was wrong when he tweeted that 122 prisoners released by the Obama administration from Gitmo had returned to the battlefield. In fact, it was mostly by the Bush administration. Will he retract, or even apologize for that, given that he also called it a ""terrible decision"" by the Obama administration, and given that that was incorrect? That there still has been no proof either of his tweets about widespread voter fraud or the wiretapping? Does the President have a credibility problem? MR. SPICER: No, look, I said yesterday -- I think Trey asked the question -- that the President meant the total number of people. Q: But he said the Obama administration. MR. SPICER: I understand that, I'm actually explaining it. That's why you asked the question. He meant that the total number of people released from Gitmo was 122. What the President -- but just to be clear, there's a big difference -- under the Bush administration, most of those were court ordered. The Obama administration took great steps -- they talked about -- it was a campaign promise, frankly, from day one to close Gitmo. This President is very clear that he understands the nature of the threat that the people in Gitmo pose to our nation, and the recidivism rate that there are among people that we have released. That is a concern that he shares. The reason the Bush administration did it was in many cases they were under court order. The Obama administration made it actually a priority to let people go and to actively desire to close that camp and to release more and more of those people, especially in the waning days. There is a huge contrast between the posture and the policy of the last two administrations on how they were dealing with Gitmo. This administration understands and the President has been very clear that he understands the people that are kept in Gitmo pose a danger to our country and to the rest of the world. There's a big, big difference between the posture of those two. Q: Do you acknowledge that the tweet was wrong? MR. SPICER: I just said it. I said that the tweet -- he meant that it was -- the totality of the people. That's what I said to Trey yesterday, I'll say it again to you today. Dave Boyer. Q: So can I just follow up on something else you said, Sean? A totally different topic, because you said that you're in full -- you're in sell mode, completely in sell mode. And I wonder if the President sees this as a test of his ability to make a deal, something that he really talked about, something that voters responded to on the campaign trail. Is this essentially, does he feel, on him that this is him going to show the American people that he can get this deal done? MR. SPICER: Well, he gets -- he is a dealmaker. He's a negotiator. He's a world-class business leader. And he's been highly successful at it. So if anybody can get a deal on something, it's going to be Donald Trump. That's part of the reason I think that the American people -- what they saw in him, that there was so much broken with Washington that when it came to the big problems -- whether it was domestically or internationally -- that if somebody could come in and work across party lines, work with another country to get a deal that was in the country's best interest, he had that skillset. And that's why they, frankly, elected him President. So I think he feels very good about the product that we've put out. We are in sell mode. We want to get this done. But the President has an open mind. He enjoys meeting with people and hearing ideas about how to make this country better, how to create jobs, how to create a better healthcare system, how to create better schools. And if there's someone that comes up with a better idea that will help lower costs and increase access, he's certainly going to listen to it. Dave Boyer. Q: Sean, yesterday in the President's meeting with the deputy whips he was talking about his tax cut plan. He said it's going to be the biggest since Ronald Reagan, maybe even bigger. He said, ""I know exactly what we're looking at, most of us know exactly the plan."" So my first question is really easy. Tell us about the plan. MR. SPICER: What the plan is? Q: The tax cut plan. MR. SPICER: Well, again, I'm going to wait until -- thank you, I appreciate the layup, Dave. (Laughter.) But I'll leave it to him to work with Congress. When we're ready to roll it out, we will do just that. We're not there yet, so let's go on with the next hopefully -- Q: Secondly, building on these jobs numbers today that look very positive, obviously there's a lot of CEOs out there who are excited about the possibility of a tax cut plan, and yet the President has also expressed a lot of concern about the national debt. If you're going to get a tax cut on the level of Ronald Reagan, a historic-sized tax cut, how are you going to do that, balance the needs for continued job growth with the concerns about the debt? MR. SPICER: Because I think that one of the best ways to get the national debt down is to grow the economy. The more the economy is growing, the more we can get it at three, four, five percent, the more the deficit goes down. That's just the best way to tackle the deficit is to grow the economy, put people back to work, create a deeper manufacturing base. I mean, that is -- between that and some of the efforts that the President has put in to make government more efficient and effective, and save money at that level, those are the two things that I think combine to get the deficit down. Jennifer. MR. SPICER: Hi, Sean. Of the more than 13,000 Syrian refugees who are in this country, less than 150 of them are Christian, Shia, or Yazidis -- the same groups that the U.S. government acknowledges are literally being at risk of being wiped off the map. So I wonder, now that Secretary Tillerson has had time to settle in and as you review the refugee program, immigration policy, is this something that's being discussed? Is this a priority to give these groups some relief? MR. SPICER: Well, I think that you know that when we talked the first time about the executive order, it was something that we acknowledged. There is definitely an area where -- in the executive order that we just passed, one of the areas that we talked about was -- and I'd have to go back and look at the exact phraseology, but we recognize that certain groups, and they can be religious in nature, are being persecuted, and I think that that's going to be a factor on how we look at that program. It's something that the President, as you mentioned, he's talked about in the past. It's something that Secretary Tillerson has acknowledged. And that's not just refugees coming into this country, but I think one of the reasons that we need safe havens in Syria is to make sure that groups and individuals, whether they be part of a group or religion who are being persecuted have a degree of safety that they can count on. Q: Thanks, Sean. Appreciate it -- MR. SPICER: No, no. Q: Mike, Maria. Q: Right here, thank you. MR. SPICER: It's International Women's Day, Mike. Q: Exactly. Thank you so much. So the President is on the record saying that he supports some sort of legalization for many of the undocumented people in the country. And you know there's a DREAMer that was caught in the raids in Seattle, Washington. We don't know if he is going to be released or not. Does the President want to or plan to meet with DREAMers to talk about what's on his mind about gathering ideas for some sort of legalization? And if so, when would that meeting occur? MR. SPICER: The President, I think, has talked about how he wants to tackle this holistically, and back to Chris's question a second ago, I think he has made clear that if there's someone who has the ability to strike a deal, to get people in a room and acknowledge well, we have to stay true to our principles, that we can get a deal on a way to fix our broken immigration problem, it is him. We are not at that phase yet. This is something that he has talked to senators about, and I think that, as we continue to move forward, obviously, the focus now is on Obamacare, repealing and replacing it with this program. But it is something that we're going to continue to move forward with, and as a comprehensive thing -- not just the illegal issue, but the visa issue, how we deal with the other folks that are in this country. But stay tuned, we've got more to go on this. We'll go further. What's that? Q: No meeting on the works with DREAMers? MR. SPICER: There is nothing on the schedule at this point. Q: I'm sure you're aware of reports that the President had ordered the Pentagon to step up the attacks on al Qaeda in Yemen. Does this mark a new strategy rather? And does the President delegate now to the Pentagon attacks on either ISIS or al Qaeda? MR. SPICER: Well, I think the President talked about this a lot during the campaign, about giving the authority and trusting the generals and the decision-makers of his national security team with executing what they need to, to prosecute the war on terror and the war against radical Islamic terrorism. So it's not a question of delegating authority. There are certain things -- and we addressed this in the briefing in previous weeks -- but there's a big difference. He's not delegating the authority, but making sure that they have the ability and the timeliness to act in an appropriate manner to prosecute the case and to go after terrorists in a way that they probably weren't last time. So I mean, there is a big difference between the approach of this President and the last administration in terms of giving the generals and the leaders in the national security team and the Defense Department the tools and authority they need to prosecute the case against ISIS. Sarah. Gabby, sorry. Q: Thanks, Sean. You'll get it one day. MR. SPICER: I know. You guys switch. Q: Israel's defense minister said yesterday that U.S. officials had sent a direct warning to Prime Minister Netanyahu against annexing parts of the West Bank. I wanted to know if that was at the request of President Trump. And then also, if you could tell us where the White House is in terms of reaching a deal with Israel on what they consider permissible settlement construction. MR. SPICER: Well, as you know, yesterday, the President spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu. That conversation largely had to deal with areas of regional security. I don't have anything further to readout on that, and I know that when they met here at the White House, there was discussion of settlements, and the President was very clear about what his desires and his wishes were. I think as we continue to follow up with Israel in the coming weeks, we will have more on that. Q: Thank you. Ronica Cleary with Fox 5. I have a follow-up question to actually his asking about the thousands of women who have chosen to strike today, and you saying that it is a free country. But at Channel 5, we've reported quite a bit on the schools and the districts that are closing because so many women chose to strike today. So it is a free country, but what would be the President's reaction to, if you will, what is more important; the students being at school today or the woman's right to strike and kind of make a statement, if you will, on this day? MR. SPICER: Yeah, thanks, Ronica. I think it's an important question. I mean, you've -- I know, locally, this affects a lot of individuals throughout Northern Virginia and Maryland and the District. So look, I think -- I haven't talked to the President specifically about this. Obviously, as I mentioned, people have a right to express themselves under our First Amendment, as the President is doing today by making sure that we appropriately salute the contributions that women make to this country. But there's clearly an impact in the case of schools -- localities throughout the country, here in the greater Washington, D.C. area. But I think that that concern is best utilized by parents through their local school boards and through their city councils and mayors, whether or not they found it appropriate for that to occur. I have not spoken to the President about this, but I think there's a balance. And I think that -- I would hope that we should use this opportunity to recognize the role of women in the workplace, in the family, and throughout society for the contributions that they continue to make and have made in the past in making the country as great as it has. So with that, one last thing, just to clarify. I think Jill asked this, but I just want to be really clear on one point, which is, there is no reason that we should -- that we have to think that the President is the target of any investigation whatsoever. I'm sorry, that was Margaret. I apologize. Q: Specifically counterintelligence. MR. SPICER: Right, and there is no reason to believe that he is the target of any investigation. I think that's a very important point to make, and so -- Q: So retract your previous -- MR. SPICER: No, no, no. It doesn't -- what I'm saying is -- hold on. The one question dealt with whether or not the tweet dealt with wiretaps during the thing, the other is an investigation. They are two separate issues, and there is no reason to believe that there is any type of investigation with respect to the Department of Justice. Thank you, guys. I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you. See you guys -- Q: -- leaks? MR. SPICER: Not that -- I can't comment. Thank you, guys. END 2:50 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-03-09,"1:04 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Good morning, everyone. Q: Afternoon. MR. SPICER: Thank you. Appreciate the -- John Roberts fact-checking from the seat. (Laughter.) Good morning -- good afternoon. (Laughter.) It's not my fault, it's on the paper. After receiving his daily intelligence briefing this morning, the President led a National Economic Council listening session with CEOs of small and community banks. Since 2008, the number of small banks has declined 30 percent. The dramatic increase in regulation following the financial crisis has been a major driving force in the decline of these banks. Dodd-Frank alone has resulted in 22,000 pages of new regulations. While large banks can hire armies of compliance officers whose sole purpose it is to ensure they meet the ever-growing number of regulations, it increases the cost of doing business for community banks, leading some not to engage in some forms of lending, or simply due to the time and costs involved. Our community banks are key funding sources for small-business owners, entrepreneurs, farmers and ranchers across the country, many of whom can't qualify for traditional loans. They provide approximately half of all loans to small businesses. By reforming the regulatory system so that it is efficient, effective, and appropriately tailored, we will stop treating these critical institutions in our communities the same as banks that have exponentially more in assets, enabling them to engage even more with small businesses and entrepreneurs that stimulate local economies. The banks participating in this listening session are members of the American Bankers Association and the Independent Community Bankers of America. A full participant list is available to those who are interested. Yesterday I noted the continued signs of good news in our economy in terms of hiring, and the morning reports showed that consumer comfort has risen to the highest level in a decade. I'm sure last night you also saw the report that illegal southwest border crossings are down by an extraordinary 40 percent, a significant deviation even when you consider the seasonal trends. These measures reflect that both the economy and the border are already responding to the President's agenda, even while we're still in the beginning stages of putting his policies in place. The country and the world are clearly ready and waiting for the change that the President campaigned on and is already delivering. Right now, the President is holding a legislative affairs lunch with OMB Director Mulvaney and key members of Congress on his plans for the federal budget and repeal and replace that we've talked about. This is just the latest opportunity to continue the dialogue between the President and members on Capitol Hill on turning his ambitious agenda into action. The strong relationship between President and congressional leaders will be key as the budget process moves along. As Director Mulvaney has been saying, our budget blueprint will be released in mid-March, and the President is working collaboratively with both his Cabinet and Congress to create a budget that keeps the President's promises to secure the country and make the most efficient use of taxpayer money. In attendance at the meeting from Capitol Hill are Senator Crapo, the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Chairman Cochran; the Senate Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee; Senator Mike Enzi, the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee; Senator Bob Corker of the Senate -- member of the Senate Budget Committee; Congresswoman Black, the Chairman of the House Budget Committee; Congressman Thornberry, the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee; Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio; Congressman Meadows of North Carolina; the Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus; and Congressman Rokita of Indiana. Later this afternoon, the President will meet with former Secretary of Commerce Pete Peterson. Then the President has a meeting with Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly and the Director of the CIA, Mike Pompeo. And finally, the President will make remarks to the Senate Youth Program around 4:00 today, a tradition that began with President Kennedy and has continued through every administration. The President is honored to be speaking to this distinguished group of young men and women who are interested in pursuing careers in public service. I also want to mention that right about now, the Vice President is giving the keynote remarks at the Latino Coalition's Policy Summit. His remarks focus on the particularly negative impact of Obamacare on small businesses, many of who have been unable to hire more workers, or were forced to scale down their operation due to high taxes and burdensome requirements that were imposed by the law. The President is dedicated to improving the healthcare system for every American, including small businesses owners who have especially been suffered -- have had to suffer through complying with thousands of pages of regulations and rules. That's exactly why he's working with Congress to enact the American Health Care Act, which he was glad to wake up this morning and see approved by the House Ways and Means Committee. Also today, the President was pleased to see his Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, voted out of committee. We had hoped to see Seema Verma, who would be confirmed as the administrator this week as the administrator of Health Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at the Department of Health and Human Services. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats continue to unnecessarily delay her confirmation. At this critical time when we're talking about healthcare, it's ironic that they refuse to consider someone with such amazing expertise in this area. Seema Burma has worked for over 20 years in healthcare policy. She has redesigned Medicaid programs in several states, including Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and Kentucky. She's worked with governors' offices, state Medicaid agencies, state health departments, state departments of insurance, as well as private companies and foundations. She's unquestionably and uniquely qualified for her position, and especially now that health reform is at the top of the President's agenda, it's time to get her in place. This delay by Senate Democrats at this critical time is unacceptable. On a scheduling note for the weekend, the Vice President announced yesterday that he'll be in Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday with Governor Bevin. The Vice President's Office will have further details for you on that trip as we get closer. Finally, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that today is the 10-year anniversary of the disappearance of Former FBI Agent Robert Levinson from Kish Island, Iran. The Trump administration remains unwavering in our commitment to locate Mr. Levinson and bring him home. The Levinson family has suffered far too long, and we will not rest until his case is resolved. And with that, I'll take your questions. Hallie Jackson. Q: I got a couple of topics for you, if you don't mind. MR. SPICER: Of course. Q: Julian Assange says the CIA has lost control of its entire cyber weapons arsenal. Does the President agree? MR. SPICER: I think, as we've commented before, there's grave concern that the President has about the release of national security and classified information that threatens and undermines our nation's security. Obviously, he believes that the systems at the CIA are outdated and need to be updated. We are not commenting on the current situation, as is U.S. government policy, but I think the situation technology-wise at the CIA, the President has acknowledged, needs to be updated. The CIA put out a statement regarding the current situation, and I would refer you to that. Q: Follow-ups on that. Is he going to talk about that with Mike Pompeo today? MR. SPICER: He gets a daily briefing from the director, and I'm not privy to the contents of his discussion, but obviously issues of national security, including that, are probably something that gets discussed. Q: And then some Republicans have said Julian Assange should be imprisoned. Does the President agree? MR. SPICER: I think the U.S. government has had a position on Julian Assange is -- a position in the past, and I don't see anything that has changed that. He has compromised in the past -- and undermined our national security, and I think I'll leave it up to the Department of Justice to further comment on their disposition of him. John. Q: Second topic was on healthcare. MR. SPICER: Second topics? Q: Second of two topics. MR. SPICER: It's like an interview, not a press briefing. Q: The President tweeted just a little bit ago that he believes that healthcare is coming along great. We've also been watching Paul Ryan deliver a pretty lengthy PowerPoint presentation -- MR. SPICER: Very good PowerPoint. Q: -- seeming aimed at convincing Republicans to get onboard this plan. Isn't that a sign that healthcare is not actually coming along great? MR. SPICER: I think anybody who has been in Washington for a few days or longer recognizes that any major piece of legislation takes a lot of explanation. The President has been very committed to talking to members of Congress. He had another meeting last night. Something as complicated as this, that deals with one-fifth of our economy, that was a major takeover of our healthcare system, isn't a simple thing. It's a major, complicated piece of legislation that's got three prongs to it. And this is the first one -- the reconciliation piece that starts to chip away at finally repealing Obamacare. When they passed Obamacare, they rushed it so quick they gave the then-Secretary of Health and Human Services great authority to enact certain aspects of it. We now -- that would be our phase two, is having Secretary Price go through the pieces of Obamacare that he has been given the authority to, when they passed it, to help unwind a lot of the things they did. And then phase three is stuff that has to be done through other pieces of legislation that does stuff like allow people to sell insurance across state lines; that allows small businesses to pool. So there's a lot of facets to getting this pushed through, and I think that one of the things that we've been able to do quite effectively is talk to members, especially in the House, but the Vice President has been very active on both sides of both chambers to communicate how this is a comprehensive strategy in three prongs to repeal and replace it with something more effective. Q: -- for example, roll back Medicaid expansion freezing until 2018? Would he support that? MR. SPICER: Look, Hallie, I think this is going to through the process of -- it's working its way through Ways and Means today, there's a mark-up in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and I think that's where we are going to continue to see action -- in the House, and then when it goes to the Senate the President will continue to engage very actively with the House and the Senate to get this done. Q: Thank you, Sean. New York City First Lady Chirlane McCray said in a statement that Donald Trump should keep his hands off women's bodies, women's healthcare, and Planned Parenthood, which has done just fine without President Trump's advice. I wanted to know what the response from the White House was on this. MR. SPICER: Well, I mean, with respect to Planned Parenthood specifically, the President has been very clear that he's pro-life. We've worked with them to talk about making sure that there's a difference between taxpayer funding of abortion and women's health services. We have, and the President has committed to making sure that funds for women health community centers is going to be reflected by a substantial increase in his budget. He's committed to doing that, and he's trying to figure out a way to make sure that the focus of taxpayer money is spread towards community centers that provide vital health services to women, and that we're not using taxpayer funds for abortion. John Roberts. Q: I just want to follow on Hallie -- MR. SPICER: Which one? Q: In an unrelated topic. (Laughter.) Just so you're prepared. On healthcare, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas today sent a series of tweets in which he basically said, this is dead on arrival in the Senate, go back to the drawing board, adding that it is absurd for the committees to be voting on something that hasn't even been scored yet. What does the President think of what Senator Cotton said today? Does he plan on having a conversation with him? MR. SPICER: Well, we're going to engage. He has talked to Senator Cotton, and will continue to talk to any senator that has questions or concerns or ideas. It went through the Ways and Means Committee last night. I think they started at something like 10:15 yesterday morning. It is an 18 -- Q: Has he talked -- MR. SPICER: I don't believe he has talked to Senator Cotton. He's meeting with members right now. As I just mentioned, he had dinner last night with Senator Cruz. He's continuing to work both sides of the aisle, both chambers. As I mentioned yesterday, I think you're going to see a very aggressive, a very robust push. We continue to have the team out talking to local media, local radio, op-eds placed, talking to local leaders. We believe that the more we talk about the comprehensive, three-prong approach that we have to doing a lot of the things that conservatives have talked about -- to bring back cost containment, to get people to be more patient-centered in the healthcare decisions they make, allow more choices -- it's going to bring people on board. But the thing that's really interesting, John, about the current approach is that, no matter where you are, especially on the conservative side, you cannot possibly believe that the current healthcare system is an effective program. It is a monstrosity. It is a government gone wrong. And I think -- Q: I hear that, but -- MR. SPICER: And I think that we will continue to engage with him and other members of the House and Senate that have ideas, but it's going to continue to work its way through the process. As I mentioned, it went through the House Ways and Means Committee. It's currently going through the House Energy and Commerce Committee. When the House passes it, and it goes over to the Senate, I'm sure Senator Cotton and other senators will have an opportunity to have their say. That's part of the process. We welcome his ideas and his thoughts, as we do with other senators. But the President has continued to do tremendous outreach, and our staff has continued to do that. Mick Mulvaney has been on the Hill, Vice President Pence has maintained a very aggressive schedule, as well as other members of the administration, and we're going to get this thing passed with all of their input and ideas. Q: Was the President aware that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was acting as a foreign agent when he appointed him to be the national security advisor? MR. SPICER: I don't believe that that was known. I would refer you to General Flynn and the Department of Justice in terms of the filings that have been made. Q: Had the President have known that, would he have appointed him? MR. SPICER: I don't know, John. That's a hypothetical that I'm not prepared to ask. I don't know what he discussed prior to being appointed in terms of his background, his resume, his client base. I don't know any of that. I know that, from what I have read, that he has filed the appropriate forms with the Department of Justice, and I think you should ask him and subsequently them if you have any questions about this specific filing. Jon Karl. Q: Sean, just following up on Senator Cotton, he told me just a short while ago that he believes that this bill might actually make things worse than the current Obamacare. What do you say to Senator Cotton? MR. SPICER: I respectfully disagree, and I hope we have an opportunity for the team to continue to not only talk to him about what we're trying to do and how we're trying to do it, but that we'd love to hear his ideas. I mean, this isn't -- as I mentioned the last couple days -- we're not jamming this down people's throat. We're welcoming ideas and thoughts. We think this is a great vehicle to restore a patient-centered healthcare bill to drive down costs, and I think Senator Cotton clearly recognizes that the current version of healthcare that is out there right now is not sustainable. And so we welcome his input into this process. We think that the work that we've done prior to putting this together with the House is something that reflects a lot of the best ideas, and we would continue to welcome his input on this. Q: Are you open to major changes -- MR. SPICER: Hold on, Charlie. It's not -- I'm not open -- Q: Is the White House open to major changes or is it -- MR. SPICER: I think the President has said before he wants to hear members' ideas. He believes that this bill encompasses the best of ideas and the best way forward. But again, we're going to let the process work its will through the House and then subsequently through Senate. And if members have ideas, we want to hear them and want them to be part of it. This isn't getting jammed through, and we welcome that, and that's why the President continues to meet with folks. He met with individuals yesterday. He going to go meet with them today. He's going to be hitting the road. He wants to hear members of Congress, outside groups, physicians, healthcare providers, patients. But he wants people to have an input in this to make sure that we have the best possible bill that serves their needs and that don't look back, like we do now with Obamacare, and say, I wish was had done this right. We've got a system that, frankly, isn't working. And I think that, no matter where you are on the political spectrum, you have got admit that either you or a loved one, or a friend, or a colleague isn't getting the care they deserve, or isn't paying what they thought they would be paying. And I think we have to do this right so that we don't look back the way we do now and regret the way that it was done. Charlie. Q: Senate and House conservatives said that they want sort of a return to a 2015 Obamacare repeal effort. If that effort landed on the President's desk, would he sign it? MR. SPICER: Well, I think the effort that is going through right now is the vehicle that is what people are on board with. I think one of the things that we have to remember is that the process, this three-pronged process, is done for a particular reason. The reconciliation process -- which I know for most people, it sounds like a very arcane, inside-baseball congressional term -- but it only allows for certain things to happen in that repeal process. And that's why we've been very clear -- and I think Paul Ryan laid out, Dr. Price has laid it out, and Mick Mulvaney is laying it out when he goes up to the Hill -- that there's a reason that we keep talking about it in three prongs. Because there are only so many things that you are legally allowed to do through the reconciliation process. When the Democrats jammed this through, they did it in a way that they did it basically in two steps. They jammed it through the reconciliation process, number one. And number two, they gave broad authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services so at the time -- that she could unilaterally do certain things with healthcare and implement certain things that we now have to undo in the same way. What we've done that's different, though, is frankly, add a third prong, which allows for additional legislative vehicles that will go through the House and then to the Senate, that will allow some of the core conservative principles that we've talked about for, frankly, decades, about allowing more competition, allowing people to pool, allowing people to do things that we think will allow lower prices to come out of the process. And I think that's a big difference in how -- Q: So if a repeal lands on the President's desk, he would not sign it? MR. SPICER: It is going to land on his desk, because we're going to go through this process. Q: I mean repeal without replace. MR. SPICER: Well, again, I think the way that we're doing now I think is the right and the responsible way to do this. This bill will land on the President's desk. He will sign it. We will repeal Obamacare and we will put into place a system that will be patient-centered that will allow the American people to have greater choice and lower cost. Blake. Q: Sean, with the pushback that you're getting so far with healthcare, do you think it is realistic to have both healthcare and tax reform done in 2017? And I ask you that because Mitch McConnell was asked about this day, and he talked about there being certain constraints, and that the tax reform portion of it could be a 2018 item. MR. SPICER: I think we feel very confident that we're going to get a lot done -- continue to get a lot done this year. Tax reform is high on the President's priority list. I think it's high on the American people's priority list. And especially as April grows closer and closer, and people look down at their federal tax form and realize how much they're paying, and we see companies pledging to come back recognizing that these companies bought into the President's vision and agenda to make America more tax and regulatory friendly so that they would create jobs, manufacture more here. That's something that he's committed to. He understands how important it is. Look, the President is uniquely qualified as a businessman, a successful businessman, to understand what a good business climate does to job creation and to manufacturing. And I think his commitment isn't just a campaign promise; it's something that he has lived by for decades now, understanding that that's what spurs economic growth, that makes one place more attractive to invest in or to hire more people or to grow jobs. And so for him, this is deeply personal. And I think that you're going to see Secretary Mnuchin and others work on the contours of that in the next several weeks. But we intend to maintain to the schedule that he laid out. Q: The August portion is still the timeline? MR. SPICER: That's right. Eamon. Q: Thanks, Sean. On drug prices, Congressman Elijah Cummings was here yesterday. He said that the President was enthusiastic about his deal to cut drug prices. Is the President enthusiastic about that? And if he is, how much pain should drug companies be prepared to take here? MR. SPICER: (Laughter.) Ironic that you're talking about drug companies and pain. Maybe there's a pill for that. Q: Of course. MR. SPICER: Yeah. I think the President -- as you know, one of the reasons that he reached out to Elijah Cummings initially is because they share that and I think, frankly, yesterday came to a lot of other areas where I think that they can find common ground and work on issues. And I know that drug prices is something that he understands near and dear is helping many people get the care that they need, but the rising cost is something that is -- so I think as we look at the vehicle in terms of the specific legislation, they share a commitment to it. And I think that there will be continued follow-ups not just between Congressman Cummings but others as to what the best piece of legislation is and how we get that home. Q: The Democrats said that they're going to drop this bill in two weeks. Is the President prepared to push the Democrats on Capitol Hill? MR. SPICER: I don't -- I think that's a bigger conversation that we have to have with House leadership in terms of some -- maybe it is that right vehicle. Maybe Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy and Chairman Brady have other ways to achieve the same goal or work with Congressman Cummings. I don't want to be prescriptive to the House as to how they work their will, but I know that the President has a commitment to that topic and that he wants to work with Congressman Cummings and others who share that same commitment. John Gizzy. Q: Thanks a lot, Sean. MR. SPICER: John Gizzy. Q: Oh, Gizzy. (Laughter.) MR. SPICER: You're both good-looking Johns -- (laughter) -- but I'm going to -- I'll come back. Q: All right, thanks. Q: Thank you, Sean. Two questions. First, a Japanese news service is reporting this morning that the President will have a meeting with President Jinping of China in April. Does this mean that there is a new meeting before their scheduled meeting at the G20 in July? MR. SPICER: I'm not going to comment on the President's schedule or foreign leaders at this time, John. I think I've pretty much gotten that one down. So until I have something further for you, I'm just going to let you get on to your next question. Q: All right, thank you. Going back to the meeting and to your opening statement about the banks, in the last campaign, candidate Trump campaigned hard on restoring the Glass-Steagall Act, which would put a barrier between commercial and major investment banks. It, of course, was repealed in 1999 -- the repeal signed by President Clinton. Senator Sanders campaigned on this as well, noted that it was in the Republican platform in Cleveland, and said in December he'd be happy to work with the Trump administration on restoring Glass-Steagall. Is there any plans for the President to meet with Senator Sanders? And is repeal of Glass-Steagall on his agenda? MR. SPICER: There's no current schedule to meet with him. I'm sure that, as he has done with several other members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, that at some point, that will be scheduled. But we don't have anything on the books for now. But look, he's shown -- and I think today was another -- or yesterday was another example, today another example of his willingness to reach across the aisle, his willingness to look into both chambers and not just business but labor unions and other industries where we can find common ground. And I think if Senator Sanders and others want to work with the White House on areas of ways that we can improve the financial industry, we're going to do that. Q: Are you still committed to restoring Glass-Steagall? MR. SPICER: Yes. Erin. Q: On infrastructure, can you give a sense of timing, where it is on the priority list, and if these new reports that say that the infrastructure in the nation is in really bad shape, does that give it new urgency? MR. SPICER: I think the President mentioned it in the joint address. I think we're looking at a public partner private -- a public-private partnership as a funding mechanism. There is a lot of work being done behind the scenes. And I don't want to put a timeline on that. Obviously, as I just mentioned to Blake, we've got -- we're currently dealing with the repeal and replace of healthcare. I think we need to move on to tax reform. But that is definitely somewhere that is -- we're trying to figure out how to move that vehicle. There will be further discussion of that as we get closer to the budget as far as where that fits into the piece. John Decker. Q: Thanks a lot, Sean. The President had this meeting last evening here at the White House with some conservative groups. Out of that meeting, can you tell us whether the President was successful in twisting arms, getting these conservative groups to back this particular healthcare bill? And just separately, I see on the President's campaign website that there is an event, a campaign-style rally planned in Nashville, Tennessee for next week. Can you confirm that? And why did you choose Nashville, Tennessee? There's a Democratic congressman that represents Nashville -- it's Jim Cooper. Are you hoping to get some Democrats behind this bill? MR. SPICER: So in the first part of that, you saw a lot of the statements that came out last night from some of the various groups. They were very encouraging. Their guiding principle is we want to get to yes. I think one of the things that's really interesting, and I addressed it earlier, is that there's a lot of members, a lot of interested parties, a lot of groups that haven't fully heard the three-prong approach. And I think Speaker Ryan did a phenomenal job today of really laying this out. Dr. Price has done a good job. That people need to understand the totality and the comprehensive nature of this; that there are three pieces of it. And I think what happens sometimes is that the reconciliation piece of this gets lost as defining the totality of it. And people need to understand the two other pieces that achieve many goals, that healthcare advocates and conservatives have fought for, for a long time that allow great competition, that allow small businesses to pool those resources together. But there's a lot of things that occur in phase two and phase three that help bring down cost and create greater choice. It's amazing when you listen in to some of these meetings how often people say, I didn't realize that, and I didn't understand the full scope and totality of what the plan was. It's very encouraging. And then I think they -- without getting into details -- I think in a lot of cases, they've shared some ideas with the President that we might be able to find some common ground on. So we'll take it one step at a time. Go ahead. Q: On the campaign-style rally? MR. SPICER: I would refer that question to the campaign. I think the President is going to be traveling next week. And then -- but there will be -- the details of that are listed on the campaign site. There is going to be I think additional travel announced for next week on the official side. And as we get closer to either the end of this week or the beginning of next week, I'll try to have more for you. Katie. Q: The President promised to immediately terminate DACA when he got in office. It's been nearly seven weeks tomorrow and he still hasn't done it. Can you definitively say if he's going to get rid of DACA? And if not, is he giving them legal status? And what's the plan for DREAMers? MR. SPICER: I think, Kaitlin, we've talked about the status of that and the -- and how many steps we have to go through on immigration. In the past, I think we've made significant headway in achieving the President's priorities of starting the wall, driving down illegal immigration. The numbers that came out last night show that even when seasonally adjusted, we see a 40 percent dip in the people crossing our Southern border. That's a very promising sign. That being said, the executive order, the second one -- there was a lot of effort put into making sure that that was rolled out effectively and achieved the goal of protecting the country that the President sought out to do initially. So we're continuing to take steps on immigration, both legal and illegal immigration. And as I've mentioned in the past, we'll have more as we go forward. Q: So he does still plan to get rid of DACA? MR. SPICER: I think the President has been very clear about how he plans to address immigration as a whole, both legal and illegal. Katie. Q: Sean, the President is convening with conservative groups, but there's also opposition on the left. Does he plan to -- he brought bipartisanship to Washington, finally. (Laughter.) Does the President plan to meet with groups like the AMA and AARP, which supported Obamacare but are not supporting this bill? MR. SPICER: I don't -- it would be ill-advised for me to start saying who he is going to -- but I think that what we've shown over the last couple weeks is the President's willingness to meet with individuals, senators, groups. So I don't want to rule in who is going to meet, or out, but I think that I've said before with respect to members, and I'd say it again with respect to groups, that I think if people have ideas that will help provide a more patient-centered healthcare system that drives down cost, the President and the team here will be willing to meet with them. So I don't want to be prescriptive in terms of telling them who they have to meet with. Their day is pretty busy right now with the Hill, but I will get back to you on some of the other groups that they're going to meet with and we'll go from there. Brian. Q: Thanks, Sean. Two quick questions. One, this morning at the National Press Club, a local business in D.C. filed a Superior Court of suit against the President in regarding Trump Hotel. And I don't expect you to speak to that issue specifically, but their feeling less that -- as much as this administration has supported small business, couldn't he divest himself from this and support small business in the district? First question. MR. SPICER: I'm really not sure -- how would he -- in terms of what? Q: Well, there's 25 small businesses, restaurants, in the area, and they're saying that the Trump Hotel is taking all that business away from them. And couldn't he walk away from it and help out the small business in the district? MR. SPICER: Well, as far as the President's -- obviously the President has made very clear in that December press conference at Trump Tower he doesn't have conflicts and he's done everything in accordance with the guidance that was given and gone well beyond what he ever needed to do. But obviously, you can't -- your name is on certain things and that's a very big difference in terms of some of the properties that he owns. But he understands the importance of small business. That's why we're meeting with community banks this morning to talk about the lending that they need -- whether it's small business, entrepreneurs, farmers, ranchers throughout the country. He understands the role of small business in our economy and how many jobs they provide, and I think he's been a champion of it. Q: Second question was, in his speech before Congress last week, he said it's not too much to dream that at some point in time our -- and I'm paraphrasing -- our feet could be on foreign soil, and I'm guessing other planets. With the NASA budget being released yesterday, I believe, is there a major initiative for this administration for space exploration? Or are we just talking dreams? MR. SPICER: I'm going to let Director Mulvaney get into the details of the budget next week, or whenever that -- I'm trying to remember the calendar here. But when the Director comes out he'll talk about the specific funding levels. As you know, we're in the middle of this what we call passback provision where we've sent them from top -- numbers. They're sending us back their recommendations and their observations and edits and questions with respect to their budget. So we're going to take this one step at a time. Q: When he said -- MR. SPICER: Obviously he's very keen on America's role in space, and I don't want to get into specific budget priorities or numbers until we're ready to release them. John. Q: You called on me. MR. SPICER: I'm sorry, April. Q: It's very important. MR. SPICER: I know, I saw the hands. (Laughter.) Q: So, Sean, just really fast, following up on John, we're seeing the campaign information for next week in Nashville. You said something about talk to the campaign -- who's the campaign? MR. SPICER: I'll try to help get you a name. There is a campaign infrastructure still in place. It would be inappropriate for me to be commenting on campaign activities from the podium. So there's a website up, same one that was during the campaign, and I would suggest that you utilize that. But I'm only here as an official in the government so I don't want to get into that. Q: Now, yesterday, going to back to Congressman Cummings, you talked about some other issues that they talked about in that meeting, where they found common ground. I want to hit two issues. The vote irregularities, voter fraud and voter suppression -- where does the President see this coming together. We heard from Congressman Cummings, but where does he see -- we understand he's saying that voter fraud is real when there are other people saying it's not. But then there are factual documents and cases of voter suppression. So how is there a marrying of that in this President's eyes? MR. SPICER: I think that's why he's asked Vice President Pence to look into it. I would disagree with the ascertation of -- I think there's also factual evidence of people voting illegally. We saw that in Texas a couple weeks ago and in other places. So part of the reason that he's asked Vice President Pence to chair this task force is to look into the issue. But we welcome input in other areas, and it's an area that they'll continue to discuss. Sara. Q: I'm not done. HBCUs, HBCUs. Now, also, Congressman Cummings said that when he talked to the President and he brought up the issue of funding for HBCUs, President Trump said to Congressman Cummings that the President did not ask for money. Now, they came here, according to many of the presidents that I've canvassed, they came here with the intent of -- the fact that they were going to get some money from this executive order. MR. SPICER: I don't think the executive order is the -- Q: That's what their belief was. But then what I understand is that there was talk about investment in these colleges from Steve Bannon. One president wrote this down saying that ""we are looking for a plan from you to invest in HBCUs and we will execute it when we get it. And they're looking for full funding for Title 3, Pell grant full funding -- fall, spring and summer, -- as well as a one-time $25 billion investment. What does this White House think about this plan that they're trying to give back to this White House, especially at a time when you're looking at cutting domestic spending? MR. SPICER: I think, when they were here, we were pleased to roll out the executive order that talked about making historically black colleges and universities a priority in this administration, moving that sort of point person into the White House so that we could coordinate a whole-of-government opportunities for -- we talked about this. Looking at the different educational opportunities -- expand government, whether it's health or investment in sciences or even stuff like ROTC and NROTC programs that are some of these that span out of the Department of Defense. But we've got to look at how we're providing government assistance in a whole host of ways to historically black colleges and universities. I think the issue of funding will be properly addressed in the budget, and at that time -- but obviously this is something that has been discussed. The President -- Q: Is the President's request realistic? Is this funding realistic? MR. SPICER: April, I'm not going to negotiate the budget from here, but I think that the President has been -- made very clear that the vital role that they play in our society. And I think he's shown that initially by the executive order that he unveiled, and we will have further information for you as we get closer to the budget. Sara. Q: Thanks, Sean. Circling back to what you said about critics characterizing the budget reconciliation bill as the entirety of repeal-replace, how quickly does the President want to see Republicans move on phase three, the companion legislation? Does he envision those unfolding simultaneously? And then given the early opposition to the budget reconciliation bill, does the President maybe want Republicans to recalibrate their strategy when it comes to that companion legislation? MR. SPICER: I am not going to start to tell Speaker Ryan or Leader McCarthy [sic] or the Whip, Mr. Scalise, how to release and when to release legislation. But I think obviously we need to make sure that members and all Americans understand the totality of this so -- at a schedule that they see fit. And I'll let them unveil that schedule that -- they talk about the totality of this plan and the comprehensive nature in all three prongs that make up the repeal and replace part of this. It's important I think, though, for people to understand that there's a commitment to do all those things that we've talked about -- whether it's pooling or -- across state lines. There's a lot of principles and things that we've discussed that I think are important to let people -- to know about. Q: What's the assessment of the situation in Afghanistan? What is the assessment of the situation in Afghanistan, because there have been a series of terrorist attack there? And does the President have plans to send additional troops to Afghanistan? MR. SPICER: So on troops I'd refer you to the Department of Defense on that one. I think we are in the middle of a comprehensive review on our policy in Afghanistan that -- working with our Afghan partners and the Department of Defense and our key military leaders to create an approach to address Afghanistan to defeat ISIS. So we're in the middle of that process. When we have more we'll update you. But I think the Department of Defense is probably the best place to go to get that. Q: Thanks, Sean. Today, hundreds of U.S. Marines were deployed to Syria. So I'm wondering how involved was the President in that decision-making process, and is this part of his wider anti-ISIS strategy? MR. SPICER: Obviously, the President was made aware of that. This is something that was done in consultation. He understands the regional issues that need to be addressed there, and, again, I would refer you back to the Department of Defense on that. Yeah. Q: Sean, thank you. I have a follow-up question to Hallie's first set of questions on WikiLeaks. My question is -- MR. SPICER: I feel like Hallie gets, like, eight questions -- Q: The Republicans are calling for Julian Assange to be in jail or be arrested. What about the tech companies that he says that he will work with to give them these CIA hacking techniques? Should there be any legal repercussions for tech companies willing to sort of embrace and use this technology that you're taking a stance against, if you will? MR. SPICER: So, number one, I'll go back to the statement that we don't comment on validating or authenticating allegations of this sort as the U.S. government -- in terms of U.S. government policy. I will say that the President obviously feels deeply concerned about anybody, an individual or anybody, that seeks to undermine the national security of our country. I don't want to -- stay within my purview here, but I do think that I would check with the Department of Justice in particular about -- if a program or a piece of information is classified, it remains classified regardless of whether or not it is released into the public venue or not. And so I would just suggest that someone consult with them regarding the legal repercussions of any individual or entity using any piece of still-classified information or technique or product that hasn't been declassified. There's a reason that we have classification levels, and that's to protect our country and our people. And that's something that we have to maintain, regardless of how it's thought out. Zeke. Q: Sean, two questions for you. One, back to General Flynn, how concerning is it to the President and to the White House that a registered foreign agent was selected to become -- was the national security advisor for a brief period of time? MR. SPICER: Look, I think this is what he did for a living. And as the President said in the press conference, talking to individuals that are within the realm of the duties that you're going to perform is part of your job. Q: -- compensated for -- MR. SPICER: I understand that but he was being compensated, he wasn't being compensated as part of the transition, as far as I'm aware. And so he was a private citizen at the time. And when you're a private citizen, you're allowed to engage in legal activities. I don't have anything further on that, but I think there's nothing nefarious about doing anything that's legal as long as the proper paperwork is filed. Q: Sean, just real quick, it was just -- several reports out of the State Department from our colleagues that on Secretary Tillerson's upcoming trip to Asia, he will not be taking any press with him on that trip. That's a breach of precedent, certainly of the last several bipartisan administrations. Is it concerning to the White House that the administration's foreign policy might not be effectively communicated to the American public and around the world because there isn't a press pool with the Secretary of State? MR. SPICER: This is the first I'm learning of it, I'd be glad to follow up with you, Zeke. I don't know that. I think you all know that we have been a very transparent administration in terms of access to the President and his activities here. I'd be glad to follow up with the Department of State and follow up -- that you can share that with your colleagues. Margaret. Q: Thanks, Sean. Yesterday you said the President had no reason to believe there was any type of investigation with respect to the Department of Justice. Did the Justice Department give you that assurance? Because they're telling The New York Times they did not. MR. SPICER: I'm not aware of it, but that's my point, is that we're not aware of anything. Q: -- been told by the Justice Department that there is no investigation. MR. SPICER: No. Q: So there might be one, you just don't know. MR. SPICER: Right, I said I'm not aware and we're not aware. And that's why we want the House and the Senate to do what the President has asked of them, to look into this. But, no, we're not aware. Q: To discover if there is an investigation. MR. SPICER: No, to look into the situation. Q: The Justice Department is saying, though, that they never gave you the assurances that you gave us. MR. SPICER: Okay. No, the assurance I gave you, Margaret, was that I'm not aware. And that is 100 percent accurate. Q: So when you said, no reason to believe, it was, I'm not aware if there's an investigation? MR. SPICER: That's right. Right. I mean, I don't know that they're not interchangeable. I'm not aware. I don't believe -- look up in a thesaurus and find some other ways, but I don't know that there's a distinction there that's noteworthy. But we're not aware, I don't believe, that that exists. Q: What's that based on? MR. SPICER: That's based on that I've not been aware of. But that's the answer to that. When someone is asking me if I'm made aware of something and the answer is no, then the answer is no. Q: But the question was whether he was the target of a counterintelligence probe. MR. SPICER: Right, and the answer is, we're not aware. I don't know how much clearer we can be on this. Q: So it's just that White House is not aware if the President is the target of a counterintelligence probe? MR. SPICER: Correct. I'm not sure what we're dancing around the same question. Q: Well, because I think yesterday, when you came out and corrected and clarified, people took that as a definitive answer that, in fact, that was not the case that you said -- MR. SPICER: No, it means we're not aware. I don't -- just that should be the definitive answer. Vivian. Q: Thank you. I have two questions, but a really quick follow-up to Zeke's. MR. SPICER: So that's three. Q: Two and a half. (Laughter.) So can you elaborate a little bit on how and to what extent Michael Flynn was involved in shaping the current Turkey policy for President Trump? I mean, was he engaging with the Turkish leaders and -- MR. SPICER: I don't have anything on that. You can contact the NSC on that. I'm not aware. Q: Okay. So for my two real questions. First, is there any official response to the lawsuit in Hawaii over the revised travel ban? MR. SPICER: I think we feel very comfortable that the executive order that was crafted is consistent and we're going to go forward on this. But I think, by all means, I don't want to -- we feel very confident with how that was crafted and the input that was given. Q: Okay. Thank you, and the second thing is Nigel Farage was at the Ecuadorian embassy in London today where Julian Assange happens to be staying. We don't know if they met or not, but was he there? I mean, he's a close ally of President Trump. Was he there in any official capacity? MR. SPICER: I don't keep his schedule. Q: Was he delivering a message? Do you know if there was contact on that? MR. SPICER: I have no idea. No. I have my own concerns here, keeping track of what everyone is doing. I generally don't worry about what is going on across the pond. Johnathon. Q: You already gave me one, but just to follow through. (Laughter.) Q: I'll take his. MR. SPICER: Wow, all right. Hey, hey. Q: But the question is not what, but Farage -- can you tell us he just wasn't there on behalf of the White House? MR. SPICER: Sure. I don't -- this is silly. I really don't think asking where random foreign leaders are and whether or not they are there -- I'm sure he was there doing whatever on behalf of either the -- Q: -- ally leaders -- MR. SPICER: He's a member of -- Q: He had dinner with the President -- MR. SPICER: Okay. I understand that, but I don't keep his schedule. I'm not sure. Toulouse. Q: Two questions on two different topics. First, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin sent a letter to Congress saying that Congress should raise the debt ceiling. We know that the Office of Management and Budget director, Mick Mulvaney, when he was in Congress, he voted against raising the debt ceiling multiple times. So is Mulvaney going to support the raising of the debt ceiling and does the President support that? And is he going to push Congress to do that? MR. SPICER: I think we've got a few months to do that. I think the Secretary was making Congress very much aware. We got into -- have now been in the White House six weeks. We're approaching the 50th day here of this administration. I think we are trying to deal with the situation at hand. Part of the reason that the President has addressed a budget the way he has is to try to get our nation's debt deficit and budget in order. I think he's continuing to show a tremendous respect for taxpayer money, the way we spend money and bring it down. But obviously, there are certain things that are a little beyond our control when we walked into this building, and we're going to work with Secretary Mnuchin and Director Mulvaney to address this issue, and obviously work with Congress. Q: Second question on another Cabinet Secretary. Scott Pruitt said today that carbon dioxide was not a primary contributor to global warming. That obviously is at odds with global scientific consensus. Does the President agree that -- MR. SPICER: I think -- that's a snippet of what Administrator Pruitt said. He went on and said, I don't think we know conclusively, this is what know. I would suggest that you touch base with the EPA on that. But that's -- he has a very lengthy response, and so that is just one snippet of what the administrator said at that. Anita. Q: Two things. One, I think you mentioned at the top but I'm not sure, that apprehensions were down across the border. There was a question yesterday about the wall. Is the wall still needed if the apprehensions are down? MR. SPICER: I think so, sure. The President was very clear. It's not just needed, the President committed to doing it to the American people. And I think, while we can have a good month, and I think we'll see if that continues, that the President made a commitment to the American people to make sure that this isn't just an anomaly, and that, while they might be down, I think we have to do what we can to protect our country, both in terms of national security and economic security. So it's of course still needed, and it's a commitment that the President made, and I think one of the things that the American people, regardless of where they stand across the aisle, appreciate about this President is that he is a man that has kept his word. He talks -- he made commitments to them, and he's fulfilling them to make the country better. Goyal. Q: Sean, I said there was a second question. MR. SPICER: I'm sorry, you did. Q: I think you've been asked this before but have been reluctant to say whether President Obama and President Trump have spoken since the inauguration, although President Trump was very forthcoming about that during the transition so I'm not sure why you wouldn't mention it. But I'm just asking that again. And there was a report yesterday that said aides for both Presidents have spoken. Can you talk to us about either of those things? MR. SPICER: I'd be glad to follow up. Unfortunately I did not ask the President whether or not he spoke -- I'll be back tomorrow -- Q: Can you follow up? Can you ask about the aides? MR. SPICER: Yes, I can. I will. I keep my word too. Goyal. Q: Okay, well -- MR. SPICER: Stealing what -- all the way -- Q: It's actually me. (Laughter.) Q: Lost your shot. MR. SPICER: Look at that. Q: Can you tell about policy now on Guantanamo, how it might have changed, where things are with that? MR. SPICER: Where what, please? Q: On Guantanamo, on whether Guantanamo will be expanded, whether detainees will be brought to Guantanamo, whether they will be transferred out. Just where things are. MR. SPICER: I don't have anything to announce with respect to its expansion or its use -- expansion use. I think the President has commented on the importance of Guantanamo and the need to maintain that the people who are there are not people who seek to do anyone good. They're there for a reason, and he has no plans to close it, if that's what you're asking. As far as the future use goes in terms of expansion, I don't have anything to comment on at this time. All the way in the back, yeah. You got it, Goyal. Q: All right, all right -- MR. SPICER: No, no, Goyal. (Laughter.) You keep trying to steal his question. Q: Thank you, Sean. Two questions please. One is that -- as far as the attacks on the Indian American communities across the nation, they're not new, it happened in the past also. But the Indian American communities recently have been having candle vigils, have prayers, and all kinds of those things. And also, the Indian ambassador met with the State Department officials -- President Trump recently. So any presidential message for the Indian American community, how to stop these attacks at this time? MR. SPICER: I think with respect to -- are you talking about the event in Kansas City specifically? Q: Yeah, and another one also. MR. SPICER: I think the President -- whether it's the event that happened in Kansas City, other events, the attacks on Jewish community centers that continue to plague us -- we saw another report this morning of some unfortunate activity. I think we've got to continue to call it out, we've got to continue to root it out, we've got to continue to engage law enforcement, whatever is the applicable level of law enforcement depending on the event. But it's something that I think all Americans should be outraged and disgusted by -- and stand up for the principles that unite us, and that's what the President spoke so eloquently about during his joint address, and made it very clear that while certain policies may divide us as individuals, there are certain principles that can unite us. John Frederick. Q: And second part of my question, please, I'm sorry. As far as the U.S.-India relations are concerned, they have been great in the past and now we have two businessmen in India -- Prime Minister Modi is also a businessman, and he -- President Trump of course a great, successful businessman. So recently, high official visits have been going on from India to the U.S., meeting President Trump and officials, including foreign secretary and Commerce secretary and -- from the energy department from India. So where do we go -- what is the future under President Trump's administration of U.S.-India relations economically, trade, and bilateral -- all of those. MR. SPICER: Thank you. I think he has talked about during the campaign and the transition establishing a deeper relationship with Prime Minister Modi and U.S. -- India and businesses. And I think as we move forward in terms of our foreign policy, we'll have further updates on that. But as you know very well, he spoke very clearly and frequently about the relationship that we have and hope to continue to grow with India. John Frederick. Q: Sean, thank you. During the campaign President Trump was not shy about his desire to get the United States out of these Middle Eastern wars, yet as a question earlier, we just sent 250 Marines into Syria. Is President Trump committed to going to Congress to receiving authorization for an AUMF or a declaration of war if we continue to deploy United States troops overseas? MR. SPICER: Well, John, I think there's a big difference between an authorization of war than sending a few hundred advisors. And I think most in Congress would probably agree with that as well. I think that's a big difference between a hostile action and going in to address some certain concerns, whether it's certain countries in the Middle East or elsewhere. I would refer you to the Department of Defense on that one. I think the actions that he has done and taken with the advice that his generals have given him, his admirals as well, is something that we will continue to work on. Q: Two questions. One, first off, kind of clarifying the difference between the campaign stop and also the healthcare rollout. So Nashville will be kind of the campaign stop. How will the White House kind of pick and choose how that goes, whether it's going to be a presidential visit trying to sell the healthcare rollout, or one for the campaign? And then a second question. MR. SPICER: I think the campaign will make decisions with respect to how they want to spend their money and where they want to go. And the White House will do the same. But that's something that every President back as far as modern history has done as well. The President will be visiting several cities over the next coming weeks to engage the American people on the need to repeal and replace and other steps that he's taking to deliver on the promises that he's made as Commander-in-Chief. Q: And then a second question, I know Senator Cruz was here for dinner last night. Can you characterize the relationship between the two men? 2018 will be here before you know it. Do you anticipate the President will be there to support him in that effort? MR. SPICER: We got a few battles to get through legislatively, but I know that he enjoyed welcoming Senator and Mrs. Cruz and their two daughters last night to the White House. They had a very enjoyable time and a very fruitful discussion. But it's something that he's going to continue to do with members of both parties, both chambers, and not just here in Washington. I think you're going to see him continue to engage with governors and attorneys general and lieutenant governors. The President truly enjoys this level of engagement. He likes to sit down and talk about ideas, talk about the future of this country and get their input and ideas. And I think they talked a little business and a lot of personal last night, and it was a very enjoyable thing. With that, thank you, guys. Have a great day. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. I think tomorrow is going to be one-question Friday. Thank you all. END 2:00 P.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-03-10,"1:44 P.M. EST MR. SPICER: Happy Friday. Good to see you all. Good afternoon. Two more days until the work week is over -- (laughter) -- full attribution to Rahm Emanuel for that one. As many of you know, today is day 50 of President Trump's administration. We have a lot to talk about and a lot that's gotten done. I also want to acknowledge that today is also Brian's birthday, so happy birthday to Brian. I'll let you guys celebrate amongst yourselves afterwards. In just these first 50 days, the President has taken many key steps towards delivering on the pledges he made to the American people as a candidate. He has jumpstarted job creation not only because of his executive actions, but through the surge of economic confidence and optimism that has been inspired since his election. President Trump knows exactly what businesses need to thrive and grow, therefore adding well-paying and steady jobs to the market. Obviously, we're very pleased to see the jobs report that came out this morning. It's great news for American workers. During the first full month of the Trump presidency, the economy added 235,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.7 percent. Notably, we also saw significant growth in the construction, manufacturing and mining sectors. The unemployment rate ticked down and labor force participation rate ticked up, showing that even as more people are reentering the job market due to the economic optimism that I spoke about, businesses are continuing to grow and create new jobs. The President looks forward to continuing his work with the private sector to clear roadblocks to key infrastructure projects, withdraw from job-killing trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and slash the bureaucratic red tape that makes additional hiring difficult for American businesses. He has taken action to ensure the safety and security of the United States homeland, its borders and its people. He has proposed great rebuilding of our nation's military, following a full review of our military readiness and supported by a $54 billion budget increase. He's implemented new protections to prevent people from coming into our country that seek to do us harm. As a result of the presidential memorandum that he signed on January 28th, the President has received a plan to defeat ISIS, designed by the Secretary of Defense and the national security team. Just as he has promised during the campaign, he has made enforcing our nation's immigration laws a top priority, signing executive orders that start work on a Southern border wall, that enhance the public safety of Americans through ordering the strong enforcement of immigration laws that are already on the books, halting funding to jurisdictions in the United States that don't comply with federal immigration rules, and directing the Department of Homeland Security to hire a combined 15,000 new officers and agents to support the system and protect the nation. He's outlined an aggressive legislative agenda that includes tax reform that brings relief to small business and the middle class, a massive commitment to infrastructure investment that will generate jobs and rebuild our nation, and repealing and replacing Obamacare. In fact, just this week, he began working with Congress directly on repealing the worst parts of Obamacare and replacing it with the American Health Care Act. And this particular legislation is just one prong in the President's comprehensive approach to reforming our healthcare system. The administration is also taking additional steps to stabilize health insurance markets and start bringing down costs for the millions of Americans that have been affected by Obamacare, such as stabilizing insurance markets through regulatory reform, including the ability to purchase insurance across state lines, providing individuals and families with lower access -- with access to lower-cost options by loosening the restrictions on the financial structure of plans offered through the Obamacare exchanges. And finally, the President is committed to working with Congress on additional legislation that won't be subject to the budget reconciliation process, that will allow the purchase of health insurance across state lines; that will streamline the process of the FDA to bring down the cost of critical medicine; to allow for the expansion of health savings accounts to allow more Americans to use their funds for more healthcare costs -- healthcare-related costs, and so much more. There's a one-page factsheet that lays out the three prongs of the President's plan to repeal and replace. All Americans can see that one-pager that's available at WhiteHouse.gov/RepealAndReplace. Feel free to download it and share it this weekend. This administration is already looking forward to all that we've been planning to accomplish in the days and weeks ahead. You should have a document outlining in each of your email boxes of the President's major actions during these 50 first days. We've made it available to the public as well at WhiteHouse.gov. In terms of the schedule for his 50th day in office, the President will be having a series of meetings and calls, moving even further along on some of the most significant campaign promises that he made to the American people. After receiving his daily intelligence briefing this morning, the President led a healthcare discussion with key House committee chairs. The President thanked and congratulated the chairs on successfully ushering the American Health Care Act through the first phase of the legislative process. He noted that he was pleased to see the bill pass through both committees -- the Energy and Commerce committee, and the Ways and Means committee -- with unanimous Republican support. They discussed working together on additional legislation to further work towards turning healthcare into a system that works for every individual and family and business. Together, the President and Republicans in Congress will act decisively to keep their promise to the American people. In attendance at the meeting, including the Vice President, were Congresswoman Black, the chair of the House Budget committee; Congressman Brady, the chair of the House Ways and Means committee; Congressman Walden, the chair of the House Energy and Commerce committee; Congresswoman Foxx, the Chairman of the House Education and Workforce committee; and Chairman Goodlatte of the Judiciary committee. In addition to this Hill outreach, senior officials at the Department of Health and Human Services have met with the American Medical Association to discuss the bill, and will be meeting with additional stakeholders in the coming days. The President is committed to making the system better, and that includes making sure his team hears feedback from all interested groups in pursuit of a more affordable and accessible healthcare. This afternoon, the President had a call with President Abbas, the Palestinian authority. We'll have a readout of that call soon. The President had lunch with Secretary of State Tillerson, and this afternoon the President will meet with Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Dr. Ben Carson. He looks forward to discussing HUD's mission to create strong, sustainable, and inclusive communities with quality, affordable housing, especially the ways in which we can partner with the private sector to come up with innovative solutions to turn our public housing system around and empower our struggling communities. Looking ahead to the weekend, the President will spend this weekend here at the White House in a series of meetings with his team. The Vice President's office has already announced the details of his trip to Louisville, Kentucky, where he will participate in listening sessions with small businesses and job creators throughout the community, and then, joined by Governor Bevin, will hear from local small businesses. The Vice President will discuss the President's economic agenda, especially the repeal-and-replacement aspects of Obamacare, and how it will reduce the burden on small businesses. He will then conclude with formal remarks at the Trane parts and distribution center. Also coming up, Judge Gorsuch confirmation hearings will begin on March 20th. Yesterday, the American Bar Association reported their committee determined that, by unanimous vote, Judge Gorsuch was given a ""well-qualified mark for the Supreme Court."" The President looks forward to seeing Judge Gorsuch receive a speedy and fair hearing, and an up-and-down vote on the Senate floor. Finally, the President's weekly address is out. It discusses Women's History Month and his plans to repeal and replace Obamacare. It aired this morning on Facebook Live. It is now available to watch on YouTube and whitehouse.gov. Obviously, I encourage everyone to go check it out. And with that, I'd be glad to take your questions. John Roberts. Q: I was going to say, your pin is upside down. MR. SPICER: John Roberts always helping with the fashion tips. (Laughter.) Q: It's still upside down. Q: You wanted -- is that a distress call, Sean? (Laughter.) MR. SPICER: Appreciate that. Q: House of Cards promo. MR. SPICER: Thank you, no. There's no promo. (Laughter.) John, now on to your questions. (Laughter.) But thank you. Q: Our involvement of sending rangers and Marines into Syria marks a dramatic change in our presence on the ground there, and I'm wondering, how much autonomy is the President giving General James Mattis to involve U.S. forces on the ground in Syria? MR. SPICER: A U.S. Marine artillery unit and a team of rangers have recently positioned in Syria to provide a combined joint task force, Operation Inherent Resolve, the commander, the agility to expedite the destruction of ISIS in Raqqa in particular. The exact numbers and locations of the forces are still a sensitive order to protect the location of the forces, but there will be approximately an additional 400 enabling forces deployed under existing authorities for a temporary period to enable our Syrian partnered forces to accelerate the defeat of ISIS, specifically in Raqqa. I think, as I've mentioned before, one of the things that the President has ensured is that the commanders have the flexibility to do what they need to fulfill the mission. The President is obviously, as Commander-in-Chief, made aware and signs off on all of those missions, but at the end of the day, it's going to up to the generals to execute their mission to make sure that we continue to defeat ISIS and protect the nation. Q: Now our involvement there really sort of complicates the whole picture because we're aligned with the Kurds, but then at the same time, a NATO ally, Turkey, sees the Kurds as the enemy. And then there's what happens with Russia and its involvement with the Syrian government. So the big problem with Iraq was we never planned for the day after. MR. SPICER: Right. Q: So what are the plans for the day after here when Raqqa falls? Who occupies it? MR. SPICER: Well, one of the things that I mentioned in the script that is part of what the President has done during his first 50 days is issue an executive order on January 28th for the Secretary of Defense to submit a comprehensive plan in consultation with the joint chiefs and other members of the national security team to defeat ISIS. That is part of that plan. And so I think you are seeing a comprehensive approach to not only how we're going to engage in Syria, but the total defeat and elimination of ISIS. So that is part of an ongoing process that the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and others have been involved in, in briefing the President. Q: But does the President have an idea of who should occupy Raqqa? Should it be Kurkish forces? Should it be a coalition? Should American forces stay there? MR. SPICER: I think that as we devolve that plan I'll have more for you on that. I think you've already killed one-question Friday, but we're going to get back to it. Jon Karl, one-question Friday. Q: Okay, I'll make it one. Sean, the chair and ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee have asked the Justice Department to turn over any information that they have that there was any wiretapping of President-elect Trump, candidate Trump at Trump Tower. If there is no evidence that any wiretapping took place, will the President apologize to President Obama for making such a serious charge? MR. SPICER: Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I think it's important to see where that goes, and I don't want to prejudge their work at this time. Jim. Q: But if there's no evidence, I mean, what's he -- MR. SPICER: But I think you're asking, well, what if there's evidence? I'm not going to get into a series of hypotheticals, prejudging the outcome of a report or an investigation that hasn't occurred yet. I think once that's done, we'll respond appropriately. Jim. Q: Thank you, Sean. Senator Cory Gardner was reported by Politico yesterday to have said he doesn't believe that a $14-billion wall along the Mexican border is the best way to provide border security. Does the White House see support for the border wall weakening in Congress? MR. SPICER: No. The President was very clear that was something that he campaigned on and promised the American people as an effort to both protect our national security and our economic security, and he's going to fulfill that pledge. He's already started to work with the Department of Homeland Security on both the plans, and the funding mechanism and the bidding and the RFP process will roll out slowly -- or shortly, I should say. But that's a pledge that he intends to maintain. John Bennett. Q: Sean, a lot of action on the Hill of course with healthcare lately, but April 28th is right around the corner, government funding expires. Given that during the transition period you guys asked for a short-term CR so you could weigh in once you were in office, what's the White House doing right now to avoid a shutdown? I talked to some sources, they couldn't point to specific talks. So what's the state of play there? MR. SPICER: Well, Director Mulvaney is going to release his budget on the 16th. That's the first step in working with them to get the budget under control. We're approaching $20 trillion of our debt, and I think we need to get spending under control. And so part of funding the government goes hand in hand with keeping track of what we're spending it on and how we're spending it on, what our priorities are. We've begun that passback process that we talked about internally within the executive branch. Director Mulvaney has had several conversations with members on the Hill on both sides, and he's going to continue to have them. I know the Vice President has been actively engaged as well. But to your question, I mean, that's part of the process. We need to release a budget first about what our priorities are for the coming fiscal year, and then make sure that we do what we can going forward. But this goes hand in hand with that. Q: -- finish out the current fiscal year, so does the -- MR. SPICER: I understand. That's fiscal year '17, but I think they go hand in hand. I think you need to close out FY17 and then I think our budget lays out where we want to go in FY18. And I think once we have a handle on FY18, we can start to backfill 2017. Q: -- a specific ask, you want cuts for the rest of '17? MR. SPICER: I'm not going to -- I appreciate -- we're not having that discussion here. John Gizzi. Q: Thank you, Sean. And I will honor the one-question Friday. The President has said in the past the he welcomes compromise, and they're open to compromise on the immigration legislation that's coming up. This morning when she spoke at the Christian Science Monitor press breakfast, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that she would like to see the comprehensive immigration package that passed the Senate but was stopped in the House brought back, and that was her version of a compromise on immigration. What's the administration's position on what former Speaker and Minority Leader -- MR. SPICER: I think you're referring the Gang of Eight bill, correct? Q: That's correct. MR. SPICER: I think the President's been very clear during the campaign trail that that's not a bill that he supports. But he looks forward to engaging with members to find a way forward to fix our broken immigration system. That bill in particular I think is a nonstarter. It was a nonstarter when it came out the first time. I think it continues to be a nonstarter. But the President recognizes that the system is broken and that he wants to work with Congress to fix it. Hunter. Q: Thank you, Sean. Does the White House believe there's such a thing as the deep state that's actively working to undermine the President? MR. SPICER: Well, I think that there's no question when you have eight years of one party in office that there are people who stay in government who are affiliated with, joined, and continue to espouse the agenda of the previous administration. So I don't think it should come as any surprise that there are people that burrowed into government during eight years of the last administration, and may have believed in that agenda and what to continue to seek it. I don't think that should come as a surprise to anyone. Q: And will the Director of the CIA or the DNI have a presidential mandate to seek these people out and fire them or purge them from the government? MR. SPICER: That's not part of the CIA's mandate under any circumstances, so I don't know on that. Blake. Q: Sean, thanks. The DNC just put out a statement a little while ago saying it is President Obama who deserves the credit for the February jobs numbers. MR. SPICER: I'm sure they did. Q: My question to you, how much do you feel that President Trump should be credited for that, and how would you characterize the economy that President Trump was handed over by President Obama? MR. SPICER: Look, numbers are going to go up and down. We recognize that. But I think there's no question when you look at the CEOs that hire people and the CEOs that have talked about the investment that they want to make in America -- you can look back over the last several administrations, I don't believe I've ever seen the number of CEOs and businesses come out and talk about investments and continuing investments and the expansion of investments or hiring based on the vision and agenda of an administration the way they have in this one. And so it's not just a question of what we believe. I think if you look at the automakers, the other manufacturers, and, frankly, some of the service industries that have come out and talked about the investment that they're going to make, or the continuation of a project that they had going, or the movement of one -- of a manufacturing plant or job investment -- those speak for themselves. It's not a question of what we believe. I think it's a question of the commitment that U.S. manufacturers and job creators and businesses are making because they want to buy into the President's agenda and vision for creating a more tax and regulatory business-friendly environment to grow here. And I think that those speak for themselves. Q: Do you believe, though, that he's had -- that the policies already have had an impact on them? MR. SPICER: Absolutely. Look at the confidence indexes. They're all going to the top. I think the stock market has generated over $3 billion of additional wealth since he was elected. There are several economic indicators that show signs of strength because of the President's vision and agenda. And I don't think that that's any secret. I mean, when you talk to the economists, when you talk to business leaders, they have confidence in the President's agenda that it will yield for a more favorable business climate to hire more Americans, to expand the manufacturing based in America, to make us more competitive around the globe. And so I do believe that. But I don't think it's a question of what I believe or what the administration believes. I think if you look at what outside economists and what business leaders do, they confirm that. Eamon. Q: Thanks, Sean. In the past, the President has referred to particular job reports as ""phony"" or ""totally fiction."" Does the President believe that this jobs report was accurate and a fair way to measure the economy? MR. SPICER: Yeah, I talked to the President prior to this, and he said to quote him very clearly -- ""They may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now."" (Laughter.) Sara. Q: Thanks, Sean. Could you clear up what appears to be some tension between what you said yesterday about when the administration or the President was made aware of General Flynn's foreign lobbying ties and the AP reporting today that the transition team was informed of Flynn's potential need to register? MR. SPICER: So there's a big difference between when he filed, which was the other day -- two days ago -- and what happened then. What the AP is reporting, just so we're clear, is that a personal lawyer of General Flynn's contacted a transition lawyer and asked for guidance on what he should or should not do. The lawyer was instructed that that wasn't the role of the transition, and that it was up to the personal lawyer to work with the appropriate authorities or subject matter experts to determine what was appropriate and what was not appropriate in terms of filing. But this was a personal matter. It's a business matter. It's not something that would be appropriate for a government entity to give someone guidance on when they should file as an individual -- as a private citizen. That was the guidance that was given, which is consistent with what should be done. And so I don't think it should be a shock to anybody that if you asked a government lawyer what you should do in your private capacity as a citizen, they're going to tell you you should consult experts in that area to determine what you should or should not do. Q: That advice was -- the transition was aware of that advice, why wasn't that then -- was the President made aware that that recommendation had been given to his national security advisor? MR. SPICER: Well, wait a minute, Sara. There are tons of individuals that consult with the lawyers and with ethics experts and say, I own this stock, will I have to sell it? I own a business. I own this house. And for the most part, they're given guidance as to, hey, go seek professional help, consult with this entity, consult with a lawyer. It's almost like asking someone for tax advice, calling -- and what you will -- if you call the IRS and say, hey, I want to know what I should do this, they will tell you to consult a tax attorney. That's not the job of a government official, is to tell you what you should or should not do in your capacity as a private citizen. And so that's a vastly different scenario that any -- whether you -- regardless of what department you call in government, if you call the Department of Education and ask them about education standards, they'll probably refer you to a local entity or to a teacher if you're asking about your own child. That's not why government officials -- they're very clear about the line between private action and government action. Jordan. Q: Thanks, Sean. Does the President agree with House conservatives that the sunset date for the Medicaid expansion should be moved up to the end of next year? MR. SPICER: Well, I think the bill that is before the House right now, the reconciliation piece -- and again, I cannot reiterate it enough -- is part of a three-prong process. But the current process does several things. Number one, it's the first time that you're going to have a full addressing of an entitlement like this in decades. It is actually a very, very good thing for conservatives when you look at how we're going to address Medicaid and an entitlement that many conservatives have fought for years need to be addressed. But that being said, the President has also been very clear through all of the discussions -- and I've commented on that throughout the week -- that as he meets with members of Congress and outside groups, that if someone has got an idea that can make this legislation more accessible, give more choice to the American people, drive down costs, make it more patient-centric, he wants to listen to it. But I think right now that's where the bill stands. We're going to continue to listen and work with members of the House and then eventually the Senate. And so I don't want to prejudge where -- the process itself. But the bill was crafted in a way that I think represents the President's thinking and in a -- very smart way of addressing entitlements and going forward. Francesca. Q: So just to put a pin in it, the President is willing to negotiate on the sunset of the expansion of Medicaid? MR. SPICER: Right. Right now the date that's in the bill is what the President supports. He is willing to listen to individuals on different aspects of the bill that might make it -- that might achieve the goals that he set out. But it's not a question of negotiation. We have a date in the bill, and that's the date in the bill. But I think as the bill continues to work its way through the House -- and that goes for Speaker Ryan, he's got members that are approaching him with ideas and I'm sure he's listening to them as well. Senator McConnell is probably dealing with the same issue in the Senate. And that's the way that the process is going to work. And I've made it very clear since the get-go that this process is going to be one where we're going to take the best ideas, we're going to listen to individuals and try to make sure that we achieve the goals that the President has laid out and the principles that he has laid out. Francesca. Q: Thank you, Sean. Piggybacking off John and John, at a breakfast this morning -- the same one he referenced -- Nancy Pelosi also said, ""It couldn't possibly be true"" of the President's allegations against the former President, ""because that is not how our system works."" She also said ""Obama would not do that"" and ""it would be a waste of time"" for the House Intelligence Committee to investigate that allegation. Does the White House have any evidence to refute House Minority Leader and former Speaker Pelosi's claim? And could you explain why the President hasn't asked the FBI chief about this directly? MR. SPICER: I think we spoke very clearly about what we'd like to happen last Sunday and I'm going to reiterate it: We believe that the House and Senate intelligence committee have the appropriate forum and process and staff to look into this matter and report back. Q: Sean, on Flynn. Can you say that the President was informed at all about this arrangement? MR. SPICER: No, he was not. Q: The need to register as a foreign agent? MR. SPICER: No. Q: And then did this set off any alarm bells with anyone? MR. SPICER: No, just so we're clear, you wouldn't -- General Flynn filed with the Department of Justice two days ago. How would anyone know that he was going to -- I mean, that's sort of like asking -- Q: What about the need to file? MR. SPICER: That's up to his personal lawyer. I mean, again, each person that goes through the process in government seeks counsel in many cases regarding the assets they own and the activities they conducted as to what they have to do or not do. But this is something that -- it's like asking whether someone needed to file -- if they had a client, whether or not they have to file a lobbying disclosure form. That's not up for us to determine. That's up for them and their counsel to determine if they engaged in activities in the past or whatever it is. Or if a doctor needed to go and up their certification, that is not up for the government to determine. There are certain private citizens' activities that you conduct and you seek counsel on, or professional advice. That's not up to the government. And that's exactly how the system worked. Q: But how did that not raise a red flag? I mean, you have an attorney calling -- MR. SPICER: You already got your question, John. We're doing one-question Friday. Q: But this is an important point. MR. SPICER: No, it's not, John. Q: Because you have an attorney calling the transition saying that the person who is in line to be the national security advisor may need to register as a foreign agent. And that doesn't raise a red flag? MR. SPICER: No, it's not a question of raising a red flag, John. It's a question of whether or not they gave them the advice that they're supposed to, which is, it is not up to them to make decisions as to what you need to do or not do. As you know, there are certain activities that fall under each of these requirements as far as what the threshold is, what activities, who the funding source was, et cetera, et cetera. It is not up to -- nor is it appropriate, nor is it legal -- for the government to start going into private citizens, seeking advice and telling them what they have to register or not. That would be the equivalent of walking through someone's tax return and saying that's not a deduction that you should take, that is. That's why, when you contact these agencies, they will tell you, you should seek counsel or professional advice or expertise in whatever matter it is. That is not up to them to determine, plain and simple. Glenn. I called on Glenn -- John, we're going -- Q: Moving beyond the legal question here. MR. SPICER: Thank you. Q: Just to follow up with John, moving beyond the legal question here, this is an issue of judgment about who you guys wanted here in your administration. There were published reports that your potential national security advisor had dealings with the government of Turkey, a controversial regime at this moment in time. Congressman Cummings sent a letter to Mike Pence during the transition informing him of this and raising a red flag. Mr. Pence was on television, I believe yesterday, saying twice that he had no knowledge of that letter. MR. SPICER: That's right -- no, no, that's not -- hold on, it stop there. No, no, hold on, before you accuse the Vice President of certain things -- Q: Yeah. MR. SPICER: Now, what he said was that he was not aware of the filing, just so we're clear. And he wasn't. Thank you. Go on. Q: But just in terms of the larger question here. Forget about filling out forms and the legalisms here. What does this say about the transition team's judgment about still appointing him as national security advisor when you had knowledge of this information? MR. SPICER: No, but you're asking me -- forget about the legalisms. That's what we ask people to do, is follow the law. You can't forget about the legalisms. Q: No, no. MR. SPICER: No, no, that's what you said. And what I'm saying is, that's what we did. They consulted a lawyer, which everyone who had something of -- is advised to do. That lawyer consulted the transition lawyer, who said, it is your job to consult the appropriate lawyers. Q: I'm moving beyond the legal issues, I'm saying in terms of -- we're moving beyond the issue of the papers here. We're talking about the judgment that the President, the Vice President and your team made to select this man as national security advisor when you had information that he had these dealings with Turkey. Why did you guys still make that decision? MR. SPICER: But it's a question -- what dealings are you referring to? The fact that he had a client -- he was also the head of the department of -- the Defense Intelligence Agency, unbelievably qualified, 40 years in the military with impeccable credentials. I mean, so what is it? That he -- what exactly are you getting at? Because so far, he has impeccable credentials, he had a stellar career in the military, widely respected, and I think for you to start to impugn his integrity -- Q: No, but Vice President Pence said that yesterday -- that he wouldn't have that -- MR. SPICER: But again, but there was no disclosure at the time. And the question is, is that if his counsel worked with whomever he worked with and determined that he didn't, that's up to him. But it was up to him. The burden is on the individual to seek the legal advice or professional expertise to decide what they have to file and not. I mean, we could literally have a hypothetical question about somebody who made an inappropriate filing on their tax returns or another -- or a professional qualification. At the end of the day when people present it with you, they are advised to seek expertise and counsel and legal advice about what's appropriate and what's not. That is not -- it is not up to the transition attorney to go through someone's livelihood and determine what they need to see. They were given the proper legal advice at the time, which was to seek expertise in that matter. He had already obtained counsel, and that's -- Q: Let me just sort of clarify. The transition officials were not overly concerned by his relationship with the government of Turkey? MR. SPICER: It's not a question of overly concerned, Glenn. The question is, did they provide him the avenue that they were supposed to, which is, did they tell him to seek counsel, and they did. And that's what's supposed to happen. That's it, plain and simple. Yes. Q: Sean, I guess the question for you very simply would be then right now, does this raise concerns that there may be other members of this administration or other members that served in the transition that were or are currently lobbying on behalf of foreign governments right now that may be advising the President of the United States? MR. SPICER: Look, I think we trust people to fill out the appropriate forms that they need to, and in this case -- Q: But that's what betrayed -- MR. SPICER: -- and the President acted accordingly back in the thing, and he made the right call then. Q: He may have been taking actions, though, he may have made the right call -- the national security advisor. MR. SPICER: But you're asking me -- this is -- look, this is like saying -- can you tell me that the executives at NBC News have gone through every single person's and reporters background -- Q: They're not the President of the United States. MR. SPICER: No, no, I understand that. But we trust people to fill out the forms that they're required to do so in an honest and legal manner. And in this case, he retroactively filed the forms that he was supposed to do, but we advised him to do what the legal and proper thing was, and that's the right thing for this administration. So we did the right thing then, and we expect every employee to follow the law. This President, when it comes to ethics and when it comes to lobbying, he instituted a five-year ban, he banned people -- he has ran on a commitment to drain the swamp. He has been very committed to making sure that we institute high standards here and that we're held to them. And so at the end of the day, when he found out that General Flynn had betrayed the trust of the Vice President back in the day, he let him go. The President has high standards for everyone that works in this administration. So the answer to your question is, if somebody does something that is not in keeping with the President's standards that he's set for every single person in the administration they will be let go. Q: So do you have full faith in all those people that are advising the President right now? MR. SPICER: I believe that everybody has done what has legally been required of them, but I can't tell you that every single person has done everything. I can tell you the President has made clear to every person in this administration you are expected to live up to the high standards that he has set for them, and that if you don't you will be dismissed. Q: Sean, the removal of South Korea's President, what's the reaction of the White House to it? And also, we know that there will be a presidential election very soon in South Korea, and we know several leading candidates. They prefer -- last confrontation was DPRK and also opposed the deployment of a THAAD system. So does the White House looking to the impact of the election might bring? MR. SPICER: Well, I believe they have to have an election within 60 days. There's an acting President who we have strong relationships with, and we will continue to work with South Korea. They are both an ally and a friend in the region. This is obviously an issue that we continue to keep up with on the developments there. It's a domestic issue in which the United States takes no position in the outcome of that election. It's up to the Korean people and their democratic institutions to determine the future of their country. The United States continues to be a steadfast ally, friend and partner to the Republic of Korea. And that's it. Q: Obviously, you guys were excited about the jobs report but maybe a little too excited, both you and the President tweeting within an hour of the jobs data coming out, which is a violation of the federal rule. So I'm wondering I guess both if there is counseling in you and the President's future? But also what you'd say generally to critics who say, the risk of doing this is politicizing what should be kind of nonpartisan -- MR. SPICER: What I understand is that that rule was instituted to deal with market fluctuations. I could be wrong, but I believe that's why it was instituted. I think tweeting out ""Great way to start a Friday,"" here are the actual numbers that you all have reported, is a bit -- I mean, don't make me make the podium move. (Laughter.) I mean, honest to god, like, every reporter here reported out that we had 235,000 jobs, 4.7 -- there isn't a TV station that didn't go live to it. So to tweet out ""Great way to start a Friday,"" I think, yes, the President was excited to see more Americans back to work. I don't think that's exactly a market disruption. I think that there's a lot of excitement in this country when we look at the policies that the President has instituted to help put more Americans back to work. So I mean, I understand the rule, but let's -- Q: The Obama White House, for instance, went out of their way not to comment in that hour-long period. They would rearrange the President's schedule around it. It was something that they and previous -- MR. SPICER: I get it. And I think there's a difference -- Q: -- going forward, yeah. MR. SPICER: It's not about commenting. I think it's one thing to give analysis and whatever; literally tweeting out great news. I think, yes, we are excited that when the President and the rest of the team saw the news this morning, as reported on every television station, Twitter, the Internet and every major news site in the country and around the world -- we were excited to see so many Americans back to work. So I apologize if we were a little excited. And we're so glad to see so many fellow Americans back to work. But that's -- Ashley. Q: Sean, Congressman Cummings' letter to the Vice President in November did lay out that General Flynn was being paid to lobby for Turkish interests during the campaign. Why did that not raise a red flag to the Vice President? MR. SPICER: It's not a question of raising a flag. Remember -- I think we keep forgetting something -- his attorney then went to a transition attorney who was told, you need to seek counsel on this and get further guidance. That's the job. It's not a question of ""raise flags,"" it's not for us to adjudicate whether or not someone needs to file under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, the FARA Registration Act. That's not the job of a transition attorney. It's to tell them to seek additional counsel, or to explain to them where to find that information, not to tell them what to do or not to do. Q: But I'm asking about Vice President specifically -- not saying you should go to this attorney or giving legal advice, but why, when this information was brought to the Vice President's attention, didn't he raise questions, bring it to the President, look into it further? MR. SPICER: Because I think it's fairly simple to say why didn't this occur. We're going through several people. The answer is, did they seek the appropriate professional advice and counsel, and they did. And that's the answer. Alexis. Q: I have a healthcare question for you. MR. SPICER: Oh, good. (Laughter.) Q: Aren't you relieved. MR. SPICER: That's the appeal about it. Q: Would the President be willing to sign legislation -- is he flexible about the refundable tax credit portion of the House bill? Would he be willing to sign legislation that avoided that particular provision? Because, as you know, conservatives are concerned that that's an additional entitlement. MR. SPICER: I think that, more and more, as the President talks to members of Congress and outside groups -- number one, I think they're excited to understand the totality of this, and I think he addresses this in the weekly address that you can at whitehouse.gov, that continues to explain the comprehensive aspect of this. Our reconciliation piece, the administrative piece that Secretary Price will institute, and then the additional legislation -- buying healthcare across state lines, allowing small businesses to pool their things, allowing health savings accounts to expand, the streamlining of the FDA, going after medical malpractice -- all those things that bring costs down. But as I've noted before, I mean, people have to remember that if you get your healthcare through your employer, which the majority of Americans do, you are not taxed on that, your employer is not taxed on it. It is fairly inadequate and unbalanced for small business owners, ranchers and farmers, sole proprietors to have to face a disproportionate tax burden because they're not a big employer. I think this is something that conservatives should be embracing, and I think the more that they understand the comprehensive nature of this, they are beginning to support more -- Q: So the President wants it to stay, the refundable tax credit provisions? MR. SPICER: Oh, absolutely. Q: Okay. Q: Yes -- House Republicans that wrote a letter to the White House asking about why IRS Commissioner John Koskinen is still in his job. Do you have any response to that? MR. SPICER: I don't. I'd refer you to the Department of Treasury on that. Yeah. Q: Thank you, Sean. The other day, the President tweeted that, for the past eight years, during the Obama presidency, Russia ""ran over"" the United States and, in particular, picked off Crimea and added missiles, which the President described in his tweet as ""Weak!"" Given that he seems to be focused on Crimea, at least as far as the tweet is concerned, will the President use the authority and funding granted him in the NDAA to send lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine, as has been called for by the House and Senate Armed Services Committee chairmans, and was in was in both party platforms, although the Republican language was watered down? And if he's not going to -- I did ask you this about several weeks ago when Senator McCain sent a letter asking for this -- if the President doesn't want to do it, is that because he would rather focus his efforts with Russia on partnering to try to defeat ISIS? MR. SPICER: Well, I think Ambassador Haley has noted at the U.N. that any attempt to undermine sanctions that currently exist because of the annexation of Crimea will remain in place until that issue is resolved. I'm not going to -- the President, when it comes to his overall negotiating strategy, has made it very clear in a variety of circumstances that his philosophy is not one that says, ""I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do."" He holds his cards close to his vest to maximize his negotiating strategy. Q: But why does sending weapons to Ukraine have anything to do with sanctions? MR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into the President's negotiating strategy. I will tell you that, as he continues to engage with the President of Russia and Secretary Tillerson -- Q: (Inaudible.) MR. SPICER: I'm not. We're not -- Ryan, it's your birthday. You get a question. Q: Going back to -- my staff, we've got about several dozen emails on -- we talked to congressmen this morning who were getting these emails saying, if you're going to repeal and replace Obamacare, why not give everybody what Congress and Senators get? Can you address that, since Congress won't? MR. SPICER: Well, I think part of what we're trying to do, we -- someone asked the other day about federal benefits. Right now, a third of the counties around our country have one provider. That's not choice. I think the President understands that very clearly, and that's, frankly, why he's pushing the American healthcare -- you know, why we're doing this, is that so many Americans have no choice, and that he wants there to be greater choice and lower costs. By doing the stuff that we're doing, especially the third prong of this -- allowing competition over state lines, taking the government mandates away from what they have to include -- that's really going to institute more choice. There will be more options. If you remember, prior to Obamacare, you could go out on the open market and go from a variety of different options and tailor what you or your family needed based on the conditions that you sought or the deductible that you wanted. And choice dried up with Obamacare. I think that's the point, though, is that if you want more of that kind of a system, then this is the bill and the legislation and the comprehensive approach that you should be supporting. Q: But specifically, the perception that somehow senators and congressmen get better care than the rest of us. Can you address that? MR. SPICER: Well, that's what I -- yes, I think that's why we're trying to pass it the way we are. We want more choice. We want more competition. We want lower costs. The American people deserve a better healthcare system, and that's what this President is pushing for. Margaret. Q: Sean, did the White House sign off on Secretary Tillerson's decision not to take the press with him on what should be an important trip to Asia, and the growing North Korean threat? And what are his marching orders? You talked a lot about the flexibility the President has given to his generals. What flexibility has he given for diplomatic initiatives to his Secretary of State? MR. SPICER: As I mentioned at the beginning, the President is having lunch with Secretary Tillerson. I know that the trip was one of the topics of discussion, and so I will try to follow up with that. And with respect to the first part of the question, press is being invited to that trip. They're traveling commercially. There is a press logistics component to make sure that they can get everywhere, that they're given access to everything. There's a press conference -- Q: You can possibly to go to all three of those cities commercially to cover him in the way that -- MR. SPICER: The plane that the Secretary is taking doesn't accommodate that, but they have made accommodations for members of the press to cover everything. And I know that -- Q: Is that something you advised to him? MR. SPICER: No, we don't get involved in the logistics for every Cabinet member's trip. I would advise you to touch base with the Secretary, with the State Department on this. But I know that they have made aware of the concerns of some of your colleagues, and they are making accommodations in the future with respect to the size of the plane. But make no mistake about it, there is a logistics component to make sure that the press is welcome throughout the trip and at every stop, and that accommodations are taken care of, and there's logistical support to do that. There will be a press conference component as well. Q: Would you like, though, public diplomacy and this kind of important diplomatic initiative for this administration to be covered fully going forward? MR. SPICER: I think it will. I hope it will be covered fully. Q: And should they be -- reporters allowed to be on the place with the Secretary, as they have for many years? MR. SPICER: And I think that, when appropriate, they can. And again, there's a big difference between making sure that we carve out X number of seats and making sure that we have transparency and openness in covering events. They have logistical support for you all, to make sure that you have hotels. There's travel support. There's accommodations and filing centers. I mean, at some point, this isn't about blocking anybody. They've gone above and beyond. Not every plane can accommodate every member of the press. Q: You couldn't get a bigger plane? MR. SPICER: It's not a question -- there's an element of tax -- Q: Most Secretaries of State can accommodate that. MR. SPICER: Thank you. I understand that, and there's an element of cost-savings at this point that the Secretary is trying to achieve. But at the end of the day, there has been a press component to every stop of the Secretary's trip. He is doing everything he can to logistically support the press who wants to come and cover him, and they are being open to make sure that Secretary is available throughout the trip. Q: President Trump has been -- was very critical of German Chancellor Merkel on the campaign trail. I was just wondering, how does the White House think that will affect the tone of the meeting on Tuesday, and what type of tone does the President plan to take? MR. SPICER: I know that we did a bit of a readout earlier today on that. There's a lot of excitement on both sides of the ocean for this trip. I know that we are looking forward to meeting with the Chancellor and her team, and I've talked to their folks over there and they're very excited about coming over. There's a lot of trade and economic interests on both sides, and obviously there's an element of national security that we share. And so I will let the trip's -- look forward to the readout, but there is a lot of excitement coming. And I think the President looks forward to meeting with the Chancellor and discussing areas of shared national interest with her. Athena. Q: Just following up on all of this Flynn discussion. I gather from today and yesterday, correct me if I'm wrong, I want to make sure I understand the answer to this question. Are you saying the President was not aware that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was acting as a foreign agent when he appointed him to be national security advisor? MR. SPICER: Correct. Well, and just remember, you wouldn't know that until he filed. He didn't file until two days ago, so therefore, nobody would have known that because he hadn't filed as a foreign agent until two days ago. Q: My understanding is that he had filed a lobbying disclosure with Congress in November. MR. SPICER: Again, that's different than filing a FARA request with the DOJ. Q: And one more question -- MR. SPICER: Well, it's one-question Friday. (Laughter.) Q: It's very much attached to this. MR. SPICER: All right. Q: The other question is, did Flynn disclose he was acting as a foreign agent in the security clearance review before he became NSA? MR. SPICER: I don't know the answer to that question. That's something that you should follow up with General Flynn on. April. Q: Sean, I want to go back to the numbers. When is it when a former President's spillover ends and the new President stands on his own merit? When does that happen? MR. SPICER: Well, I think on January 20th at noon, you start to assume command of the government, and -- what specifically are you asking for? Q: The numbers from jobs. You're taking -- MR. SPICER: Well, I think that this is the first full month that encapsulates the President's administration. I think that's a very telling number. Look, and I get it. These numbers are going to go up and down. But I think for the first full month, we're seeing the enthusiasm and spirit that so many business leaders have been drawn to, and that is exciting as a first month. But I think this encapsulates a full 30 days of the Trump presidency, and so we're going to continue to work forward with policies that will lower regulation and lower taxes, create a more business-friendly and entrepreneur-friendly business climate to allow the expansion of U.S. companies and grow U.S. jobs. Q: And lastly, over the last couple of weeks we've heard all the negatives -- well, not all the negatives, but a large portion of negatives about the Affordable Care Act, and how you're looking to make it patient care. So with that, are there any positives which you could articulate from ACA that will carry into possibly patient care? MR. SPICER: I think children being able to stay on their plans to 26. There's a preexisting-condition piece. But again, remember -- Q: That's going to states, the way we understand it. That's subject to -- MR. SPICER: No, no, no, but that -- you're asking if there's elements. I think those are some things that -- and again, remember, there was some stuff that was part of the ACA that is stuff that Republicans had supported for a while as well. I think this is making sure that this is the most effective and comprehensive healthcare policy that achieves the President's goals. Q: So those are the only two? Those are two -- MR. SPICER: Yes. You asked -- I don't know, April, I'm sure I could go through the bill and get back. It's very long, as you saw the other day. It's a thousand-page -- Q: -- pages versus -- MR. SPICER: Nine hundred seventy four pages. Very good. David Jackson. Q: The Palestinians are saying that President Trump invited President Abbas to the White House for a meeting very soon. Can you confirm that? MR. SPICER: I can. Thank you guys very much. Let's end on a positive note. Have a great weekend. We look forward to seeing you. Take care everybody. Thank you. END 2:44 P.M. EST"
Donald J. Trump: Background Press Briefing by Senior Administration Officials on the Upcoming Visit of Chancellor Merkel of Germany,2017-03-10,"10:32 A.M. EST SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'd like to welcome all of you to this backgrounder. I'd like to start off by setting the ground rules if I can. So this is going to be backgrounder only. Attribution is going to be senior administration officials. And anything that goes on in this room is embargoed until we walk out of the room to allow us to get you the best information that we can. We're going to start with a brief statement and then we'll move to a Q&A. So you can address -- we're going to introduce everybody. You can address your question up here and we'll figure out who the best person is to answer you. So, again, thanks for being here. And I'll start off by allowing everyone to introduce themselves. *** SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I'll start with just a quick statement here to lay out some of the context for this visit. So the President is very much looking forward to welcoming Chancellor Merkel to the White House on Tuesday. This will be their first meeting, and the Chancellor's first visit to the United States in over two years. The level of interaction between this administration and the German government has so far been frequent and robust. To name just a few interactions, Vice President Pence met the Chancellor last month in Munich. The German foreign and defense ministers were here last month as well. Secretary Tillerson was in Bonn for the G20 Foreign Ministerial last month, and Secretaries Mattis and Kelly attended the Munich Security Conference. So we're very pleased with the level of interaction so far, and we trust that this will continue. When he meets the Chancellor, the President will express his and the American people's appreciation for the deep friendship that exists between the United States and Germany. We share so much history, and the bonds between our people are strong. Germany is one of our most important allies and partners in the world, and we cooperate with the Germans on everything from counterterrorism to European security to generating strong economic growth. Germany is one of NATO's strongest member states, and the President looks forward to talking with the Chancellor about how to strengthen the NATO alliance, including by ensuring that all allies shoulder the proper share of the burden for maintaining our collective defense. Every ally has to meet its commitments -- something we know the German government believes as well. So we are heartened by the German government's determination to reach NATO's benchmark of committing 2 percent of GDP to defense by 2024. The President is impressed by Chancellor Merkel's leadership at a time when the states of the North Atlantic face a number of significant challenges, and he looks forward to consulting with her on our shared challenges. We recognize, in particular, Germany's leadership role, alongside France, in resolving the conflict in Ukraine and Germany's enduring commitment to peace and stability in Afghanistan. Germany also plays a central role in the global effort to counterterrorism and violent extremism, particularly through its contributions to the counter-ISIS coalition. The United States is committed to strengthening our political defense, security and economic relationship with Germany and with Europe more broadly. We will continue to stand together with the German people, and we are looking forward to Chancellor Merkel's visit on Tuesday. Q: Does the President that Germany is contributing enough money to NATO? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So the President believes that all allies must shoulder their share of the defense burden. And as I mentioned, he is heartened to hear that the German government is committed to meeting the Wales pledge of spending 2 percent of GDP by 2024. Of course, the messages from the administration so far have been strong and consistent that all allies need to be making progress towards this 2 percent goal. And he is heartened so far by the signals he has seen from Berlin regarding increases in their defense budget. And so I expect that will be definitely a topic of their conversation for the concrete plan to meet this commitment. Q: What will the President say will be the consequences if Germany does not meet its commitment in terms of NATO? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can't answer that question at present. I think they're going to have a robust discussion about exactly how to operationalize this goal. And so I don't want to speak to any part of what the President's private discussions and negotiations will be on this issue. Q: Is 2024 acceptable to the President, or would you like it to be met sooner than that? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, of course, that's going to be a discussion that he's going to want to have with all allies, including the Germans. But during his planned participation in the NATO leaders meeting at the end of May, I'm sure this is going to be a topic of discussion about whether it is really feasible for all allies to accelerate that timeline. And so, again, this is going to be a topic of robust discussion. Q: And with the Germans in particular, as a leading economy and one of the participants in NATO maneuvers in other places like Afghanistan, does the President believe it's especially important for Germany to set this example and to be out in front of this and ahead of the 2024 timetable? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: He does believe that Germany, as one of the largest economies within NATO, should be setting an example and should be leading by example, as we do from the United States. And so I'm sure that, again, this is going to be a topic of discussion about how concretely we get there, to the 2 percent benchmark. Q: Hi, I have two questions. Will the President be discussing with Chancellor Merkel any of the allegations that Russia is potentially interfering in European elections? And also, will the two of them discuss any sort of engagement with Russia to resolve the Ukraine crisis? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So, sure, what I can say is that the President will be very interested in hearing the Chancellor's views on her experience interacting with Putin. Of course, she's been doing this for more than a decade. She's met with Putin I think for at least a couple of dozen times. And so he's going to be very interested in hearing her insights and what it's like to deal with the Russians. He is also very interested in hearing her insights into the Minsk implementation process and really how we can work together to resolve the Ukraine conflict. Q: What about the allegations that Russia is seeking to interfere in various European elections? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, I don't have a comment on that issue for you right now. Q: How do you plan to get around the potential awkwardness of Chancellor Merkel being a strong proponent of a strong EU? A strong proponent of immigration when the President sent very signals about that? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I think the Vice President, during his visit in Brussels, gave a pretty clear message that we are interested in maintaining our strong and enduring partnership with the European Union. We recognize that the European Union makes significant contributions to global peace and prosperity, and so he's going to be interested in exploring this topic more with the Chancellor. Q: Thank you. A follow-up to the question on Russia. The Ukrainian process that you referred to, is it envisioned that the U.S. might play a big role in the process, a direct role? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I think, again, this is going to be a topic that the President is going to want to discuss with the Chancellor, what role the United States can most helpfully play in this process. But I don't want to prejudge the outcome of the meeting. Q: Hi, I have a question about the EU. Some of the EU officials have been saying they're really worried about President Trump's views towards the EU. Can you tell us a little bit more about that? About how the EU is valued or how it's not valued, and how the conversation might happen? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, well, so I would refer you back to the Vice President's comments, which were very clear and direct when he was in Brussels, about the value that we see in our partnership with the European Union, and again our recognition that the European Union is a key contributor to global peace and prosperity. And again, I'm sure that the President will want to discuss again his views of the European Union with the Chancellor. And again, I can't comment exactly on how that conversation is going to go or prejudge the outcome, but I'm sure it's going to be a topic of discussion. Q: You didn't mention climate in your opening statement. Do you expect that to be a topic of discussion, and what will the President's message be to Chancellor Merkel about his commitment to either staying in the Paris Agreement or withdrawing from the Paris Agreement? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. Q: What's going to happen in the interim? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: It's quite possible that that will be something that the Chancellor will raise. They don't know for sure. Internally, the United States is still working on that issue, and that's an issue that still is to be determined and will be discussed, I'm sure, with the Chancellor, but also further clarified in the weeks and months ahead, as we move forward to the G7 and the G20 ministerials and summit meetings. Q: Will the President be in any position to clarify what he want to do with the Paris agreement? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can't speak for the President on that. I know that we're working on that issue internally. Whether we reach a decision by the time of the meeting or by the time of the summit meetings I think is still unclear. Q: And just on refugees, the President has been pretty critical of the Chancellor for her stance on that topic. Do you expect that to arise in their talks, and in what fashion will the President -- that? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. Yeah, we expect it to come up. They've talked about this issue already on the phone. And you know, at this point, it's how we move forward on this. And so the United States and Germany are doing quite a bit on counterterrorism, cooperation on border security, internal security cooperation. We have the NATO action that we've already had in the Aegean to help with migrants crossing from Turkey. So the talk is out there, but there is quite a bit of work going on that we will continue to discuss behind scenes. And I'll leave it at that. Q: The President was sharply critical of Chancellor Merkel on the campaign trail. What sort of tone would he like to set for this meeting? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm not aware of what criticism was on the campaign trail -- Q: -- migration. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I think the statement that my colleague made is very clear that the issue is one of several that is part of a very robust and expansive -- term in American relationships. So it'll come up, and we can have disagreements within the relationship, but, as I said, I think both leaders are determined to -- working together forward on how we address the issue moving forward on the security element, on the funding element, economic element. I'll leave it at that. Q: And what's the President's thinking in terms of how to get the Ukraine crisis resolved? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't know if we want to think -- I can't say on the President's thinking specifically, but he recognizes the leadership role that Germany and France have on this. And certainly the point of this meeting is to determine how we go forward in cooperation with France and Germany on this issue. And that's why we're very pleased to be having this so early in the administration. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Let's get a few questions from the back row. Q: With the current prioritization of defense spending by the administration, it would appear that the commitment to NATO is going up and not down, even as the President says money is pouring in from other countries. So what data is informing that? And then a second question is, will the President be endorsing Chancellor Merkel for reelection? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We don't endorse foreign leaders in foreign elections. Those are elections that will be run on domestic issues and domestic processes. On the NATO issue, can you repeat the specifics of that? Q: So the administration has said that defense spending would go up, and that of course is part of our contribution to NATO. So it would appear that even though he's been critical about how much the U.S. is putting toward NATO, that that would actually be going up, not down. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, yes, so I mean, the way that the NATO budget -- or the commitment to defense spending is calculated, I mean, you look at the U.S. defense budget, it's -- we're a global power. So we are committing part of that to Europe, part of that to Asia, elsewhere in the world. So the commitment to defense spending is going to affect Europe, it's going to affect other parts of the world as well. And he's been very tough on the issue, and I think that he's done so in a way that has encouraged the Europeans to look at increasing the commitment as well. We've already seen the statements from the Chancellor and the government on this -- the German government, the foreign minister -- on the commitment to get to 2 percent. So we're encouraged by that and so, in many ways, we lead by example on what we put into defense. We expect the Germans to do so as well, and that's very much going to be how they approach the issue I think in the meeting. Q: I guess I'd like to ask two questions. One is, how detailed do you think there can be of a trade discussion at this point? How much can you flesh out for us now on that? And I guess as part of that, do you think there will be any deliverables? Maybe it's the Paris deal, maybe that's what it is. And then -- well, I have a second question but I'll wait. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm not aware of any specific deliverables. That's not the purpose of the meeting. It's to get together and discuss the range of issues that we have in our bilateral relationship. And it's conceivable that trade may well come up; we don't have any preconceived views that we're going to be expressing on that. We want to have an open discussion on trade issues. Q: The sort of softer question I guess is, over the course of the past year -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: May I just add, by the way, I mean, we are aware, obviously, that there was a trade surplus that Germany has with the United States, and that will probably be, if trade comes up, a part of the discussion. Q: But not in the context of the President promoting the notion of bilateral, and Merkel promoting the notion of EU is the bilateral part? Like, you don't think you're just -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, Germany is part of the European Union, so you could not have a bilateral trade agreement with them. You have to work through the European Union on that. Q: But okay, so it sounds like on the trade front, that's not going to be the hugest piece of the spending? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can't predict exactly which direction the discussion will go in. I think trade will be an issue that may well be on the agenda, and as I said, we recognize there's a trade surplus and there may be a discussion around that as well. Q: On the softer question I think that I sort of wanted to ask, we know that Chancellor Merkel has spent many months studying President Trump by watching videos and reading things that he's written, and I'm just curious, for those of you who know him well, has he been similarly interested in sort of studying what makes her tick, who she is, how to kind of figure out a way to have a relationship in that sense? And is there going to be some effort on his part -- I guess ""reset"" is probably a loaded word, but he spent months talking about people are going to overthrow her, and the Syrian plan is terrible, and all this stuff. And he probably -- they probably both want to find a way to fix that so they can be closer allies. What's his part in thinking about that? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, I am not aware that he -- whether he spent time studying her or not. I assume the purpose of the meeting is going to be to build on a personal relationship and try to have the largest country in Europe and the United States have a positive interaction on a range of issues. So the goal going in would be to have a very positive meeting. Q: The G20 -- the previous administration kept saying that the G20 is the preeminent international group for discussing economic issues. Will it be the same for the current administration? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We don't have any predisposed position as to whether it's the preeminent group or not. As you know, the G20 has dealt largely with financial and economic issues historically, and then it became converted to a summit meeting in the wake of the financial crisis. But as to what its role is in the broader play of international events, we don't have a particular opinion. Q: I guess my question is, do you think you'll be moving more to bilateral -- or are you still committed to working in these international fora? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, we will be attending the G7 and the G20 summits. We'll also be having bilateral meetings at those events. We don't see it as an either/or situation. And we'll see how the overall summit meetings go. Q: Given the recent WikiLeaks releases, and given what we know out of the previous administration, Chancellor Merkel's cellphone was hacked, what kind of reassurances can you give her and the German government that the United States is not looking into their television sets, their cellphones, their highly engineered automobiles, et cetera, et cetera. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We're not going to comment on specific intelligence allegations. We'll leave that to the proper agencies and departments to address that issue. Q: Does the President still believe that other EU countries will leave the EU, as he said in January? And does he think it's a good thing? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't know his thinking on that. Certainly it's for the countries -- it's an EU process, and I'm not going to prejudge what he thinks, whether countries should leave or not. Q: And can you just confirm that you'll have a joint press conference after their meeting? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There will. There will be a -- yeah. Q: Thank you. I understand that you don't want to discuss the allegations of Russian interference in the upcoming European elections, but does the United States believe that the elections should be held in a manner that's free, fair and without interference? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think that goes without question. Free and fair elections without interference is the gold standard that we love to see. Q: Just wanted to follow up on my colleague's question. What's this administration's view of T-TIP, given what you said about bilateral -- on trade? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We have not formulated a final position on that. We have other trade priorities that we've been looking at earlier, but T-TIP is out there and that may well also be a topic of discussion during the meetings. Q: Would T-TIP violate the President's aversion to multilateral trade deals? Or since the deal would have to be with the European Union and not with a specific country, as you said, would that then make it acceptable -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, that's an issue that we're looking at. T-TIP, as you said, is between -- one could say it's bilateral in a sense -- it's between the European Union and the United States. It also deals largely with regulatory issues and how to harmonize regulations in a way that eases trade and reduces some of the burden of a regulatory burden. And it's hard to do that if you're doing it just with one country at time. But the broader T-TIP discussions are something that will await the confirmation of our U.S. trade representative and discussions with our Commerce Secretary. Q: Would that, by necessity, have to wait until Great Britain resolves its situation in terms of the European Union and the President's expressed interest in a bilateral trade agreement with them? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: On T-TIP, I think -- by the way, on T-TIP, one should point out that the Europeans aren't going to be pushing that issue while they have a series of elections coming up through this year, including in Germany and in France as well. I don't think T-TIP is necessarily dependent on Brexit occurring, but obviously the leaving of the European Union by the British government raises a whole series of economic issues as well that we've been in discussion with the British on, and that may also come up in the discussion with the Chancellor. Q: On the relationship between the U.S. and Germany, it was particularly strong under President Obama, and then the relationship between the U.S. and the UK was sort of put on the back burner. I'm wondering if you see that continuing with this administration. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think we hope to have strong relationships with both countries. As you saw, Prime Minister May visited the first week when we were in office. The Chancellor's visit is coming very soon thereafter. They're both very important relationships with us and we want to manage them effectively. Q: Is it realistic to assume that we can have a strong relationship with Merkel under President Trump, given that -- his insults against her during the campaign trail and President Obama's particularly close relationship? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm not going to get into what went on on the campaign trail, and I really don't want to compare -- Q: What's your expectation of their personal relationship? How strong it can be? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: My expectation is that they'll have a very positive, cordial meeting. That's been the whole lead-up to it in terms of our interactions that were mentioned previously with the German representative of the German government, and I know that's the desire that we have. Q: Given the President's criticism of Chancellor Merkel's policies, particularly with respect to refugees and generally the situation he sees in Germany with regards to terrorism, does he hope to convince Chancellor Merkel to change some of those policies or to close Germany's borders in a stronger manner, like the U.S. has sought to do here? Particularly because he said that it was weakening Germany, weakening Europe during the campaign. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Those are German government decisions. Certainly they're going to discuss security comprehensively, and Europe, the North Atlantic countries. But those are decisions for the German government to make. And the discussion that they have had on this already and the discussion that they will have on this I presume will focus on the areas where we can cooperate. We don't re-litigate the past, we don't go back in and atone for things, but we go forward and look at what we can do together. And that's what the focus is going to be. Q: Given, though, that Germany is part of the visa waiver program, for example, does the President believe that those policies are a problem for the U.S.? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't know his views on that and I'm not going to comment and try and guess what his views are. Q: Just to go back one last time on the issue of Russia and cyber war. It's obviously a problem throughout Europe. It's also a problem here in the United States. Do you anticipate sort of a fulsome discussion on the issue of cyber war? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So again, I can't prejudge what the portion of their conversation is going to be, but I'm sure the cyber issue will come up because the President is very interested in us having very strong cyber defenses and in cooperation with the German government, again, on strengthening our collective defense against cyberattacks. But again, I can't comment on how much of the meeting is going to discuss that. Q: On the issue of Ukraine, you mentioned that the U.S. and President Trump recognizes France and Germany's leadership goals in resolving the conflict. But at the same time, he's obviously been very critical of the former administration's failure to find a resolution there. Do you see any room for discussion about the U.S. -- to enhance our role in the Minsk agreement? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. So as I said previously, I think that's going to be a main subtopic of the discussion on Ukraine, which is what role can the United States most helpfully play in the ongoing diplomatic process. Again, I can't prejudge what the level and the pace of U.S. engagement will be on that issue, but the President is going to be interested in soliciting the Chancellor's view on how the process is going. Again, she and French President Hollande have been at this now for a couple of years. They have a very good understanding of what the positions of the sides are. He's going to want to understand the dynamics of that negotiating process and see where the United States government can factor in most effectively on that. Q: Do you think there's any possibility that they could ask to join the Normandy format? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, I can't prejudge what they may or may not agree to, but I'm sure they will discuss, again, what level of representation on the United States side, what pace of engagement would be most helpful in this ongoing diplomatic process. Q: Does the President have a view of what he thinks has been stalling the process with regards to the Ukrainian peace process? Is there anything in particular that he thinks has been unhelpful from one side or the other, or something that he believes should be done to kind of jumpstart this process again? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm not aware of anything specific that he's said about that. Again, he is still learning about the dynamics of the negotiating process, and this meeting with Chancellor Merkel is going to be a key discussion for him in understanding in greater detail what's been going right, what's been going wrong. Q: Does he at least think that there should be a larger U.S. role in the process? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can't prejudge that. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We have time for one more question. Q: You guys have said a couple of times that you're not going to discuss what happened on the campaign trail. And I guess my question is, why not? Do you not believe that anything said on the campaign trail would have an impact between -- on relationship between the United States and Germany? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sorry, these guys aren't campaign officials. They're National Security Council staff, happy to talk about Germany and all that. Q: The relationship between the United States and Germany -- does that not have an impact, sir? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Not on the diplomatic relationship. Q: Well, I would like to thank everybody. I would like to thank my colleagues for being here and sharing your time and your insights. And everybody who is in the room and on the phone, thank you for participating. And I refer any further questions to White House press or to NSC strat-comm. And please remember that this is background only, and senior administration officials is how we're going with that. And thank you again for being here. END 11:00 A.M. EST"
Sean Spicer: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,2017-03-13,"1:20 P.M. EDT MR. SPICER: How's my pin, John?  Q: It looks good. MR. SPICER: Good Q: The tie is good, the pin is good. MR. SPICER: All right, then we're ready to go. Q: Ready to go. MR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you all had a great weekend. The President spent his weekend in a series of meetings with White House staff and advisors planning for a full and productive week.  On Saturday, as many of you saw, the President had a working lunch with several members of his team, including Homeland Security Kelly, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Ross, Veterans Secretary Shulkin, and members of his White House staff, during which they discussed immigration reform and their efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. Over the weekend, the Vice President went down to Louisville, Kentucky. He was joined by Governor Matt Bevin for a listening session with over a dozen small-business owners from Kentucky to discuss the burdens that Obamacare has inflicted on their businesses. The Kentucky business owners shared in detail how Obamacare is negatively affecting their businesses, and reiterated their support for repealing our current healthcare system and replacing with one that actually works. This morning, after receiving his intelligence briefing, the President led another listening session on healthcare with Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price. The President and Secretary Price heard from nine concerned Americans from across the country who have been failed by the broken promises of Obamacare, as well as two doctors who have seen their patients suffer from the law's misguided rules and requirements.  This listening session was another important step in the process of crafting and implementing an effective patient-centered healthcare. Americans have been watching their healthcare costs skyrocket while their choices of providers and insurers have dwindled for years.  They've received those cancellations in the mail as many as three times. They've seen urgent care and emergency rooms filled with people who can't afford their high deductibles and resorted to enduring the pain or sickness until they had no choice but to go to a hospital. They've had family members with chronic preexisting conditions whose cost of healthcare has more than doubled. And they've been forced to let go of valued employees or, frankly, unable to hire more due to staggering workers' compensation increases.  The President campaigned on a pledge to repeal and replace this unraveling system. The American Health Care Act is one part of fulfilling this pledge; it's far from the only one. He's using administrative action to provide essential regulatory relief to insurers, increasing coverage choices, and providing lower-premium options to individuals and families. He will continue to work with Congress on the additional legislation, part of this three-prong strategy to increase choice while decreasing prices, including allowing health insurance to be sold across state lines, adding to the list of healthcare-related costs patients conduct with their health savings accounts, streamlining the process at the FDA so that lower-priced generic medicine gets to the market faster, inviting small business to band together to negotiate for lower health insurance for all their employees, and reforming the medical malpractice lawsuit system so that doctors are not forced to perform unnecessary and costly procedures and tests out of fear of future litigation.  Our healthcare system is large, complex, and critically important not only to the health of our citizens, but to the health of our economy. Through commonsense, patient-focused reforms, the President will work with Congress to create a new system that doesn't impose a one-size-fits-all, government-knows-best vision on the American people. We will empower the American people to make their own choices about healthcare that make them best work for themselves and their family, that will bring costs for everyone down.  After the listening session, the President had lunch with Vice President Pence and Secretary of Transportation Chao. Later this afternoon, the President will welcome all of his confirmed Cabinet members to the White House for their first Cabinet meeting. This meeting is an important opportunity for the President to share his vision with the country with his Cabinet members, providing direction for them to bring back to their agencies and departments, to ensure that the entire administration is working towards the same goals. Unfortunately, this afternoon, you'll see some empty chairs around the table representing the President's four nominees who have yet to be confirmed by the Senate -- Secretary of Agriculture-designee Governor Perdue, Secretary of Labor-designee Alex Acosta; Director of National Intelligence-designee, former Senator Coats, and United States Trade Representative-designee, Robert Lighthizer.  Senate Democrats have drawn out this entire process for way too long, and these key agencies and departments will not be represented at the President's first Cabinet meeting. The President is confident in these unquestionable abilities of the confirmed Cabinet members that will be in attendance. He is just as confident in the demonstrated quality of the four individuals who will not be able to attend. Their absence will clearly be felt as this administration comes together for the first time to receive guidance from, and provide counsel to, the President on these unique areas of jurisdiction. Following the Cabinet meeting, the President will sign an executive order to reorganize the federal government. This order requires a thorough examination of every executive department and agency to identify money -- where money is being wasted and how services can be improved, and whether or not the programs are truly serving the American people. This is the beginning of a long-overdue reorganization of the federal government and another significant step towards the President's often-stated goal of making it more efficient, effective and accountable to the American people.  This evening, the President will have dinner with Secretary of State Tillerson and National Security Advisor McMaster. Also, he hopes to see Seema Verma confirmed as the administrator of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, another unquestionably qualified nominee who's been shamelessly prevented from taking her position at a critical post. Let me just kind of touch on the week ahead. Tomorrow, based on the current forecast, we are currently in conversations -- in contact with officials in the Chancellor's office in Germany regarding the visit. We'll have an update regarding that visit later today.  On Wednesday, the President will visit Detroit for a trip focusing on job creation and automobile manufacturing. He will meet with auto executives and workers and manufacturing suppliers highlighting the need to eliminate burdensome regulations that needlessly hinder meaningful job growth. Also on Wednesday, the President will visit Nashville, where he will lay a wreath at President Andrew Jackson's tomb at the Hermitage.  And as I told you last week, on Thursday the President will welcome the Taoiseach of Ireland for the traditional St. Patrick's Day visit. I can also confirm that the Deputy Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, will have a meeting with the President on Thursday of this week. I will have further details on that visit for you soon. And on Friday, the President will travel to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend. Finally, the President is aware of the forecast for the storm that's currently threatening the Northeast. The President has been briefed by his Homeland Security Advisor and the acting FEMA administrator on storm preparations. He has directed his Intergovernmental Affairs staff to remain in contact with governors and mayors in the path of the storm. He has directed his acting FEMA administrator to lean forward and be prepared to help states should they require federal assistance. We urge everyone to listen to state and local leaders and public safety officials to follow their warning and closure notice. They are the best source of information during that storm. With that, I'd be glad to take your questions. John. Q: Sean, if I could come back to the U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York, Preet Bharara, who was asked to resign along with 45 other U.S. attorneys. The President seemed to indicate not too long ago that he wanted Mr. Bharara to stay on in that job, and he was asked to resign like the other attorneys. And then he says he was fired on Saturday when he refused to resign. Did the President change his mind about keeping him on? Or was it only supposed to be for a finite period of time? Can you just fill us in?  MR. SPICER: I'm going to refer you to the Department of Justice on that. This is a standard operating procedure for a new administration around this time to ask for the resignation of all the U.S. attorneys. We had most of them -- or a good chunk of them had already submitted their resignation letter. This is just the final swath of individuals who had not at this time. But this is common practice of most administrations. Q: I understand that this happened at the DOJ and the request was from the DOJ, but there seems to a White House connection vis-–∞-vis the fact that the President had actually asked him to stay on, and then the President apparently called him a couple of days before he was allegedly fired. Can you tell us what that was all about? And did the President change his mind? MR. SPICER: No, the President was calling to thank him for his service. This is, as I said, a standard action that takes place at most administrations. Then-Attorney General Reno sent out an almost identical letter in 1993. The Bush administration sent out a similar one, as well. So this is a very common practice for all political appointees -- not just in the Department of Justice -- but throughout government when there's a turnover administration to ask for all individuals to do that. Major.  Q: Sean, yesterday John McCain said the President should either provide information about the allegation he put on Twitter a week ago Saturday, about his phones being tapped at Trump Tower, or retract his statement. Today is the deadline. What's the President going to do? MR. SPICER: Well, let's be clear -- the Department of Justice was asked to send information down to Congress. It wasn't the White House that was asked to do that. Just so we're clear as far as what the request was. Q: But the tweet came from the President of the United States. MR. SPICER: I understand that. And with the tweet --  Q: Does he have an obligation, as Senator McCain said, to clear this up? MR. SPICER: And I think if you look at the President's tweet, he said very clearly ""wiretapping"" in quotes. There's been substantial discussion in several reports that Bret Baier from Fox on March 3rd talked about evidence of wiretapping. There's been reports in The New York Times and the BBC and other outlets about other aspects of surveillance that have occurred. The President was very clear in his tweet that it was wiretapping, that that spans a whole host of surveillance types of options. The House and the Senate intelligence committees will now look into that and provide a report back. But I think that there has been numerous reports from a variety of outlets over the last couple months that seem to indicate that there has been different types of surveillance that occurred during the 2016 election.  Q: And so what you're saying is the President doesn't have an obligation to provide any evidence? MR. SPICER: No, I'm not saying that at all. Not at all. What I'm saying is the request that was made from the House was to the Department of Justice. I think that that's an appropriate question to ask them.  What I'm telling you is, from a White House perspective, there's no question that there have been an abundance of reports regarding surveillance and other type of activities that occurred during the 2016 election. Q: And that leads us to believe that the President's only evidence are these reports? MR. SPICER: No, no, that leads you to believe that. I'm saying to you -- Q: I'm trying to --  MR. SPICER: And I'm saying to you is that what we made clear on that Sunday was that the House and Senate intelligence committees have the means, the process, and the access to go in and look at the entirety of the evidence that's being presented to them and make a determination that they can report back to us. Q: Thanks, Sean. Following up on Major's question, does the President feel he has an obligation, once the investigation is over, to release some sort of statement in response to whatever the findings are? That's my first question. I have a second one for you.  MR. SPICER: Well, let's get there first. I think to start to presume what the outcome is going to be before the House and the Senate look at all of the evidence and information and reports that are presented to them would be a bit presumptuous. So I think -- let's slow down a little, let them look at everything, and then let them make some determinations. Q: And then my second question for you: Has President Trump donated his paycheck from the month of February, like he promised to do during the campaign? MR. SPICER: The President's intention right now is to donate his salary at the end of the year, and he has kindly asked that you all help determine where that goes. The way that we can avoid scrutiny is to let the press corps determine where it should go. (Laughter.)  Q: Oh, we have a few ideas. MR. SPICER: In all seriousness, I think his view is he made a pledge to the American people, he wants to donate it to charity. And he'd love your help to determine where it should go. Q: May I suggest the Correspondents Association -- MR. SPICER: That will be a great way -- Q: Journalism scholarship. MR. SPICER: That would be a great way to do it.  Q: Thanks a lot, Sean. I wanted to follow up with you on questions regarding Michael Flynn, who's no longer in the administration. There's a five-year lobbying ban that's been imposed upon all Trump administration employees. Does that also apply to Michael Flynn? Would he not be permitted to lobby now for five years because of the agreement that he signed when he became the national security advisor? MR. SPICER: That would be correct. I'd have to check and actually figure out when he signed or if he signed the form. But yes, all administration officials who come in are required to sign that ethics pledge banning them from lobbying for five years and then a lifetime ban on lobbying on behalf of any foreign government. Q: And then related to that, what are the repercussions if an employee of this administration lobbies within five years? Where's the teeth, what's the penalty, what's the punishment that would be imposed on that particular Trump administration employee? MR. SPICER: I'd have to get back to you, John. I don't know whether that's a Department of Justice aspect or not, but I will get back. Yeah. Q: I was wondering, did the President ask Preet Bharara to stay on during their conversation during the transition or not? MR. SPICER: I was not privy to that conversation. Again, I'm not really sure how it's relevant at the end of the day. The Department of Justice asked all remaining 46 at this time, that they asked for all of them to submit their letters of resignation based on the same kind of precedent that was set during both the Clinton and then the Bush administrations in terms of the timeline and format.  Jessica.  Q: I just wanted to ask about the reports about President Xi Jinping visiting Mar-a-Lago April 6th and 7th. Can you confirm that visit and talk about what you want to accomplish with that type of less formal visit? And secondly, with respect to that visit, you still don't have a confirmed ambassador, you don't have an assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Affairs. House ow does that affect your planning and ability to really properly brief the President and make sure he has a strong position? MR. SPICER: Planning is ongoing for a visit between President Trump and President Xi at a date to be determined. We're not ready to confirm that, and we will have more details. It's the purpose of this meeting, of that kind of a meeting, to help defuse tensions over North Korea and the recent deployment of a THAAD military battery to South Korea. Any meeting between the President of the United States and the People's Republic of China would necessarily cover a broad range of topics of mutual concern. Secretary Tillerson is traveling to the region now. So I think as we go forward we will have additional details on both the timing and the location of that when we go forward. Q: Is the implication of you saying Tillerson is traveling that he's setting up the visit, Sean? MR. SPICER: I'm sorry? Q: Is the implication of you talking about Tillerson's visit that he's going to be laying the groundwork for -- MR. SPICER: Well, he's in the region. I'm sure that in his visit to Japan, South Korea and then China that preparations will come up as well as areas of mutual concern. Q: Sean, there's been a rash of --  MR. SPICER: What's that? Q: Is it me? MR. SPICER: Sure. Let's go one at a time. Q: There's been a rash of attacks on LGBT community centers throughout the nation. Over the weekend, the community center here in D.C., Casa Ruby, was attacked and a transgender staffer was assaulted. This follows similar attacks that have taken place in recent days in Orlando, Florida, New Jersey and Oklahoma. This is not unlike the anti-Semitism that the President has already denounced. Will the President also denounce these attacks? MR. SPICER: Sure. I mean, I think that -- I think one of the points that we've made in previous statements on this is that this is not the way that we as Americans solve our differences. We don't attack each other. We don't engage in this kind of behavior. I think we have a First Amendment that allows us to express ourselves, and that's the appropriate way. But doing it when you're threatening violence or destruction or vandalism is inappropriate in all of its forms. Q: Is it connected to the withdrawal of the transgender guidance, do you think? MR. SPICER: Is it what? Q: Is it at all connected -- MR. SPICER: I don't believe there is any connection between -- I think that that would be a stretch, to say the least. Yes, ma'am. Q: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about North Korea. You mentioned North Korea. Can you tell us a little bit about the review of North Korea right now and what direction you think the administration is going in terms of the relationship -- trying to manage the threat from North Korea? MR. SPICER: As I mentioned, Secretary Tillerson is heading to the region. He'll meet with his counterparts in South Korea, Japan, and then ultimately in Beijing. That's obviously going to be a major subject. And as I mentioned, when we ultimately meet with President Xi and others, that will be a discussion; it's something that's he's talked about prior to the resignation of the last South Korean President, and was something that has been part of an ongoing discussion. So there's an internal review that we continue to have, but then there's obviously a geopolitical conversation we're having with partners in the region as we look to contain North Korea's military threat. Q: Thank you, Sean. Can you confirm that any cooperation with Russia with regard to Syria is off the table? And if not, is it fair to say that the forthcoming anti-ISIS plan does include some sort of cooperation with Russia? MR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into what the plan -- I mean, the plan is not done yet. As I mentioned a couple days ago, Secretary Mattis was briefing the principals, and that plan is continuing to evolve. So I'm not going to start to rule out one country. But I think the President has been very clear in the past that if a country shares our commitment to defeating ISIS and we can work with them in an area of shared, mutual concern, then we will do so. Q: Second question. A Kremlin spokesperson said that Russian President Putin and President Trump will meet at the G-20. Can you confirm that? And would the White House move on a possibility of a meeting before that? MR. SPICER: I will follow up on that. I don't have a date. I know that the team is working very actively with respect to bilateral meetings at the G20. I don't have anything for you on that.  Roberta. Q: Director Mulvaney said yesterday that he felt that the Obama administration had been manipulating the unemployment rate. I'm wondering if that's a view that the President shares. And what evidence is there of -- MR. SPICER: I think he was clearly referring to Obamacare, the number of people. But I would refer you back to him and his comments with respect to how he characterized that. I think he can discuss the precise nature of what he meant on that. Q: Does the President feel that the Obama administration had been manipulating -- MR. SPICER: I think you know what the President's view is. He's made very clear in the past what his comments were on how those numbers were articulated in the past. And I think there's a question between the total number of people that are employed, and the President's comments in the past have reflected that his big concern was getting to the bottom of how many people are working in this country, and that the denominator -- meaning the percentage rate of the total number of people -- is not the most accurate reflection of how many people are employed in this country. How many jobs are created, how many people are getting back to work, how many companies are committing to hiring more people is a much more accurate assessment of where we're headed as our country -- where our employment is, where our economy is headed. But to look at a number and say we have 4.7 or 4.8 or 5.9 percent unemployment is not necessarily an accurate reflection of how many people are actually working, seeking work, or want to work. And if you know how they conduct those surveys, there's a lot of times when people, whether they're older or younger, or because of how long they've been searching for work, are not considered statistically viable anymore and they're washed away. So I think how you look at the percentage of people working can sometimes be a manipulated number. The number of people that are added to the roll every year -- every month, rather -- is a much more accurate understanding of what's happening in the economy. Cecilia. Q: I just want to clarify your answer to Major's question. So will the DOJ and/or the administration comply with the deadline to supply information today? MR. SPICER: Remember, it's the -- again, it's not -- the request was made of the DOJ, and so the proper venue to ask that question of is the Department of Justice. Q: But surely, the White House knows whether there is or there is not evidence.  MR. SPICER: You can't -- because, it's interesting, in the past whenever we've had these conversations with another agency, the accusation from the press corps is that we're interfering in something. So you can't have it both ways. You can't say that we're interfering with someone when we talk to them; when we don't talk to them, it's ""surely you must know."" So -- Q: So if the President tweets something -- MR. SPICER: Hold on, Cecilia is asking a question. Q: -- and then say it's the Department Justice's obligation --  Q: This is to follow up on --  MR. SPICER: I understand that. I saw the tick-tock. I understand it. That doesn't mean you get to jump in. Cecilia. Q: So to follow up on Major's point, though, this is a tweet from the President. Doesn't the President have an obligation -- MR. SPICER: And he does, and I think we've made it very -- Q: -- to make the evidence clear? MR. SPICER: Right, and we've made it very clear that we expect the House and the Senate Intelligence Committees to do their job. I think there's a preponderance of reports that continues to come out about surveillance and actions that have occurred during the 2016 election. Once they come up with their report -- and it was asked earlier today -- I think we can talk about the conclusions of that report. But at this time, you can't say that we're going to shift it off to the House and Senate and then comment every day. That was the entire goal of asking them to look into this further. Q: But will DOJ comply with this deadline today? The clock is ticking. Q: The President instructed them --  MR. SPICER: I understand. My understanding is that they will. But again, I would ask them what their intention is, and I believe there are certain things that they can and can't do in terms of classification and stuff. But I would leave it up to the Department of Justice to answer for the Department of Justice. Kaitlan.  Q: How is the press making Obamacare look good? MR. SPICER: Well, I think when you see some of these comparisons that occur in the -- talk about who's going to win and who's going to lose, it misses a lot of the competition that's going to take place. It doesn't talk about the increased choice. Right now, as the President has noted, as Secretary Price has noted, in a third of all counties in five states you have one choice. Those analyses that are very -- trying to look at how much you'll pay and how much you won't, A, don't take into consideration the competition that's going to occur, the choice that's going to occur.  I mean, right now, you have one choice in a lot of places. You have no decision about how much you're going to pay and what you're going to get. Choice allows you to determine what scale of healthcare you need, what kind of package is good for you, your family or for your business. And when you look at a lot of these analyses when you open up various major papers, they make it seem so simple: it's how much are you going to pay for on this plan, how much are you going to pay for under the current plan. It misses an entirety of the whole process, which is that you don't have competition, number one. Number two, and the bigger point that I think the President and a lot of others are getting to, is that the system is failing on its own. It makes it seem like it's all rainbows and puppies. At the end of the day, if you have a card and you're getting a subsidy but you're not getting care, you have nothing. And so walking into a doctor's office where you can hand them a card and say, I've got a $5,000 tax subsidy -- if that doctor doesn't take the care or the deductible is so high, then you really don't have anything. And so to do an apples-to-apples comparison is hardly an accurate analysis of what the current situation is. Zeke. Q: Just going back to the counter-ISIS plan you mentioned earlier, the plan isn't don't yet. The President during the campaign said multiple times that within 30 days he wanted that plan presented to him. Obviously it's undergoing comments at the National Security Council principals level. But is the President upset that he hasn't received it yet? And does that point to a difference between campaigning and governing, that things take longer than he thought? MR. SPICER: No, I think there's a difference. The plan has been received, right. The issue, as you correctly point out in your question, is that now that it becomes an aspect of the principals all discussing different priorities, different staffing levels, different funding levels. But the plan is here, as we noted a few weeks ago. It's being reviewed, and they're providing input from different members of the principals and different members of his national security apparatus to make sure that the plan continues to evolve and is able to attack ISIS in a way that -- Q: When is it actually going to take effect? MR. SPICER: Some pieces of it are, in the sense of -- he has talked to commanders on the ground. We've noted before some of the military action that's been taken, some of the authority that's been given to some of the commanders on the ground. That is actually taking the fight to ISIS on a daily basis. I think the more holistic approach that he asked for will continue to evolve through the national security process. But make no mistake, we're on it right now. Sharon. Q: Thanks, Sean. On the executive order this afternoon, do you have a numeric goal for either reducing the size of government or saving a certain amount of money through the review of agencies? MR. SPICER: I don't know that Director Mulvaney has a target, per se. I think that's part of the issue, is that you go through each one of these and you evaluate them on the merit of what they do or don't do, or whether or not they've become bloated or duplicative, or, frankly, just outdated or in need of technological advances. But there's a lot of -- there's no set number that we're driving down to as we review government. Sometimes you just walk into an agency and you realize that agency's mission is no longer relevant, or that it's duplicative in three other agencies, or that there are too many people performing a function that no longer exists for a variety of reasons. But that's why the mission is critical that Director Mulvaney was given the mandate to go out and get all of these different agencies and departments to review themselves and to provide feedback for him as to where we could go. Gabi. Q: Thanks, Sean. You had said previously that the Republican healthcare plan wouldn't be a one-size-fits-all approach, but the current plan preserves Obamacare's health benefits requirements, which literally defines insurance at the federal level. So how do you reconcile those two things? MR. SPICER: What's missing right now is choice. That's the number-one issue. We tried to solve a problem -- when I say ""we,"" the government -- with respect to Obamacare back in 2008, 2009. And the issue was, is that in order to solve a problem for several million people being without healthcare insurance, we upended the system for everybody -- so if you had employer-based healthcare, if you had TRICARE, Medicare or Medicaid. And it was exactly the opposite approach. We went in to solve a problem that a small fraction of Americans had, and we upended the entire system, forcing premiums to go up and choice to go down for everybody.  And I think that when you can institute choice and competition back in the system, that's something that's going to benefit everybody. And that's exactly the opposite of what's happening. Q: Would phase two or three of this eliminate those requirements? MR. SPICER: I think phase two, the administrative phase, will look at a lot of those requirements, and then phase three -- and again, they're not necessarily -- they can run concurrently, and I think the House is looking at starting a lot of that legislation.  And so -- and Dr. Price is already starting to look through a lot of that administration -- a lot of administrative aspects of it as well at HHS and figure out how do we start to achieve some of this, unravel some of these pieces that are there, but instilling choice and competition, allowing people to buy their insurance over state lines, allowing small businesses to pool, allowing the expansion of health savings accounts -- all of those kind of factors that are going to drive down costs, but also having the insurance companies, frankly, be able to offer additional choices and options for people is in itself going to be a huge bonus. Charlie. Q: A lot of conservatives are complaining that -- or suggesting that the President doesn't fully back the Paul Ryan healthcare plan. Has the President spoken with Paul Ryan about the plan? And have they had any conversations about its future in Congress? MR. SPICER: They have spoken, yes. I don't know when the last time they have. But the President is fully committed to this plan. I think you saw Secretary Price and Director Mulvaney out discussing that this weekend. They're committed to the plan. And, look, Director Mulvaney made it very clear this weekend as well that if through the process we can find some ideas that make this a stronger, more patient-centered piece of legislation that will ultimately benefit Americans, then we're going to do it. We're not saying this is the only way forward. As it works its way through the House and then ultimately through the Senate, if there are ways that we can enhance the bill through the legislative process, we're willing to do that. Peter. Q: You want to read us another -- quickly -- if there's any details of the --  MR. SPICER: Would you like to know? (Laughter.)  Q: Yes. MR. SPICER: Okay, thank you. The President spoke to the Chancellor of Germany. They agreed, due to the current weather, that the meeting should be postponed. The meeting has been rescheduled to March 17th, this Friday. Same schedule of events on March 17th.  Q: All right, I'll ask my question if I can very quickly then.  MR. SPICER: Thank you for your assistance with the -- Q: That's news. You spoke on behalf of the President, quoting him on the jobs report on Friday. You said they ""may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now.""  MR. SPICER: They are very real now. Q: ""They are very real now."" MR. SPICER: Just want to make sure you get it right.  Q: The question I wanted -- when should Americans trust the President? Should they trust the President -- is it phony or real when he says that President Obama was wiretapping him? MR. SPICER: Well, again, let's get back. I think there's two things that are important about what he said. I think recognizing that it's -- he doesn't really think that President Obama went up and tapped his phone personally. Q: What does he think? MR. SPICER: But I think there's no question that the Obama administration, that there were actions about surveillance and other activities that occurred in the 2016 election. That is a widely reported activity that occurred back then. The President used the word ""wiretap"" to mean, broadly, surveillance and other activities during that. And that is, again, something -- it is interesting how many news outlets reported that this activity was taking place during the 2016 election cycle, and now we're wondering where the proof is. It is many of the same outlets in this room that talked about the activities that were going on back then. Q: So on the same topic, on the CBO report, did the President think it was real then, and is phony now? MR. SPICER: What CBO report? Q: On the expectation -- the CBO report is coming out, about which you said, ""If you're looking at the CBO for accuracy, you're looking in the wrong place."" Three years ago, you said of the CBO report, that it confirms Obamacare is bad for the economy. So the question is -- MR. SPICER: Well, it was bad for the economy. Q: Okay, so the bottom line of the question is, was it real then, and now is now phony? As you have said, it's not the place to find accuracy? MR. SPICER: Okay, so let's look at the CBO's projection. It said their projection on Obamacare was that, in 2016, it would have 24 million people on it. The actual figure is 10.4 million people -- less than half the number of people that it predicted would be insured were on it, and it's declining. So the only point, Peter, is to make sure that people understand -- if you're looking to get a bullseye accurate prediction as to where it's going, the CBO was off by more than half last time. So it's not -- this is not about what my understanding or my belief of the CBO is. The last time they did this they were wildly off, and the number keeps declining.  And so the question that needs to get asked right now, or, frankly, the awareness that needs to be brought up right now is that if you were going to look at a number tonight, I think you have to look through the scope of whether or not that number is. Now, it was bad for the economy. That was right. You can glean that in terms of the direction what the impact that it had. But as far as their numbers go -- on the number of people that they predicted back then would be covered now -- they were off by more than half. Q: I guess the question is, when can we trust the President when he says something is phony and when he says it's real? MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on. You asked a question about CBO, and now you're conflating it with the question of the President. The question is -- Q: No, I asked a question about wiretapping first. And then we went on to CBO. So the question, in simple terms is, when he says something, can we trust that it's real -- MR. SPICER: Yes. Q: -- or should we assume that it's phony? Well, no, no -- MR. SPICER: You suggest that it's real, absolutely. Q: How can we believe that it's real when you just told us that it was phony then, but now it's real? MR. SPICER: I did not tell you that, Peter. And you're trying -- Q: You told us on Friday that the President said -- the President, you didn't -- the President said the numbers were phony then but they're very real now. So how can we take anything he says that he won't later say, ""actually it was the opposite""? MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on. I think the difference is, the President was talking then and now about job creation -- the number of jobs. The issue that he brought up in the quote that you're talking about was the percentage of people who are unemployed. And there is no question that no matter how you look at this, whether you talk about 4.7 or 4.8 or whatever the number is, that number fluctuates by how people calculate who is in the workforce. Q: He said it was in the twenties or more.  MR. SPICER: Okay, Peter, let me answer the question. Q: I'm listening. MR. SPICER: You're not. Let me answer it. The bottom line is, the percentage of people who are unemployed varies widely by who you're asking and the way you do the analysis of who is actually in the workforce. The number of people who are working and receiving a paycheck is a number that we can look at. Secondly, when you're asking about the validity of the CBO report, again, I would refer you to the CBO itself. The number that they issued that would be insured in 2016 was 26 million people. The actual number is 10 -- excuse me, 24 million. The actual number is 10.4. That's not a question of our credibility. It's a question of theirs. Do you have anything more? (Laughter.)  Q: The bottom line is, the question that you still have not answered is -- MR. SPICER: I have answered it. Q: -- can you say affirmatively that whenever the President says something, we can trust it to be real? MR. SPICER: If he's not joking, of course. But in that case -- Q: So let's start over again with joking. MR. SPICER: But you're asking -- hold on -- okay, no, no. But your point is -- I mean, every time that he speaks authoritatively -- that he speaks -- that he is speaking as President of the United States. Like it's -- Q: Three to five -- more than 3 million Americans voted illegally -- was that, when he was speaking --  MR. SPICER: Yes. And he still believes that. Q: -- was he joking or does he believe it? MR. SPICER: He does believe it. Thank you. Julie. Q: Thanks, Sean. I have a healthcare question. But first, can we just get an answer one way or the other about whether the President directed the Department of Justice to respond to this? MR. SPICER: No, he did not. Q: And does he plan to? MR. SPICER: I answered the question. Q: Okay, so on healthcare, Secretary Price said on Sunday that nobody will be worse off financially and more people will be covered than are currently with the plan that you guys are pushing. Paul Ryan acknowledged that people are going to lose coverage. So what is the goal here? You just said you're open to modifications to the plan if you find that there's a better way to do it. Is the goal that people not lose coverage? Or is the goal that -- MR. SPICER: Well, again -- but there's a false argument there which is that they have coverage. People have cards, they've been told they have things, but they can't -- they keep walking in -- the President met with nine individuals this morning that they were told they're going to get coverage for something, they are told that they're going to have all these subsidies. They walk in, and they don't get covered. They don't have the care that they need. There is a difference between walking around with someone and saying, hey, I've got a card, than I have care. And that is a big, big difference.  Right now, when you have a third of the counties in this country that have one choice and going down, and number of insurers leaving markets, then the system is collapsing. So the question has to be, to everybody who is not with us on this, is what is your alternative? Because right now, the current system of Obamacare is failing every American who has Obamacare. And frankly, for those who don't have Obamacare, for those who have employer-based insurance, for those who have TRICARE or Medicare, it's driving up the costs. And in the cases, especially for those who have Medicaid, Medicare, or TRICEARE, they're going into doctors' offices more and more who are telling them, we don't accept that. Q: But you're talking about quality and about cost. I'm asking about coverage. MR. SPICER: Yeah, but that's the point, is that you're missing the point. If you keep talking about coverage -- care is what matters. If you can't walk in and get seen, if you can't get a doctor to see you, then you don't have coverage. I mean, that's what this is all about. Being told you have coverage but you can't go see a doctor, or you can't afford to see a doctor is not coverage. John Gizzi. MR. SPICER: Thank you, Sean. I have two questions. First, Democratic Leader Pelosi said on Friday that every single Democrat would vote against the American healthcare plan -- the plan backed by Republican members of Congress and the administration. The Freedom Caucus in the House has come out for Senator Paul's plan. When one simply does the arithmetic of Democratic members and Freedom Caucus members, that's a majority against the plan. How does the administration plan to overcome the arithmetic? MR. SPICER: We're going to continue to work with members of the House and then eventually the Senate. I feel very good, as the President continues to engage with members, that we will have the votes necessary. I think Speaker Ryan agrees with that as well. We're going to have the votes, this thing will pass, and we'll move on to the Senate. Q: The other question is this: In recent weeks there's been considerable attention on the upcoming elections in the Netherlands on Wednesday, and in France in a few weeks. Candidate Geert Wilders of the Netherlands was here for the CPAC conference. Representatives of Marine Le Pen of France were here. Many analogies were made between these candidates and President Trump, and they offered words of praise for him or did so through their representatives. Is he aware of these candidates in Europe who invoke his name and image? And if so, what does he think of these would-be Trumps and Trumpettes? MR. SPICER: I don't know the answer to that. I think most of these are -- we'll allow sovereign nations to have their own elections without interference. Alexis. Q: Sean, can I follow up on Peter and Julie's questions? MR. SPICER: Sure. Q: Two issues, again. Whether the President and Director Mulvaney put a lot of faith in the Congressional Budget Office, members of the Senate will, when they get -- if they get legislation from the House. So my question is, what does the President or the administration intend to do to establish to senators' satisfaction that the numbers coming out of the Congressional Budget Office, which the President will question, are not substantial and can be countered by other information? In other words, is OMB doing its own kind of score? Is the President relying on a think tank to counter the messaging? Because senators are already indicating that they will put weight in the CBO's score. MR. SPICER: And again, I think this is part of an ongoing discussion with members as far as philosophical, what do they believe, and a lot of these aspects of this plan in keeping with what they have supported in the past. Obviously, they're going to look at the score -- I get it. That's part of it. And there are pieces of it that may historically have more weighted than others. But I think this is going to be -- as I mentioned to John, I mean, it's an ongoing conversation with members of the House and ultimately the Senate with respect to whatever comes out. But in the same way that members relied on the score last time, they were way off. And I think that we have to remind them that if this is what you're basing your vote on, you have to look at the historical context in which that information was provided. I think that's an important aspect to how they do it. But I think there's going to be a ton of factors that people rely on as they do this. Q: Can I follow -- I have one follow-up. MR. SPICER: Of course.  Q: I may be confused about the wiretapping, your answers, in terms of the President's response. The President was the one who tweeted this, right, and said that he learned something. So can you just establish for me, because I'm confused, the President did discuss what it is that he had in mind, what he tweeted, with the Department of Justice before the Department 00 MR. SPICER: No, I'm not going to get into what the President knew or didn't know prior to it. I think we've already commented on this multiple times. Q: But how would the Department of Justice have any idea -- MR. SPICER: I don't know. This was a request made of the House Intelligence Committee, not to us. So I don't want to get into starting to parse what we knew or what we didn't. That request did not come to us, it went to the Department of Justice. Yes. Q: Congressman Steve King (inaudible) a tweet he put up, saying that, ""We can't restore civilization with somebody else's babies."" Does the White House have any reaction to that? MR. SPICER: I will definitely touch base with the President on that and get back to you on that. Hallie. Q: Sean, two for you. I just want to go back to something. You just said a minute ago that ""what the President meant when he tweeted about the wiretapping was"" -- and you sort of explained it. But you've also stood at that podium and said the tweet speaks for itself. When do you decide when a President's tweets, when his words are open to interpretation and when those words stand on their own? MR. SPICER: I'm sorry, can you further explain what you're asking? I mean, his tweets do speak for themselves. Q: You just sort of interpreted it for Peter, saying, well, he didn't mean that President Obama had --  MR. SPICER: That's not what I said. No, no, actually -- Q: You said when he meant wiretapping -- said it -- he meant surveillance. That's not what he said.  MR. SPICER: He literally had it in quotes. Q: So you're interpreting the tweet for us, it sounds like. MR. SPICER: No, in some cases I'll ask him, what did the quotes mean, and he'll say -- Q: Did you ask about this tweet? MR. SPICER: I did. Q: And what did he say? MR. SPICER: He said they were in quotes, I was referring to surveillance overall. It's something that had been referred to in other reports.  Q: So he cited other reports in his conversation with you? MR. SPICER: He did, yes. Q: So was that what he was basing that tweet on? MR. SPICER: As I just mentioned -- it was a good try, but I've already been clear on that. Q: I have a second for you, Sean. I want to go back to this healthcare idea. Just yes or no: Are CBO numbers legitimate, or not? MR. SPICER: That's not my determination to make. I'm telling --  Q: Does the President think those numbers are legitimate? MR. SPICER: Hallie, it depends. There are a lot of things at -- hold on, Hallie. You guys have like an NBC thing. Let me answer the question. I think when you look at whatever that number is, whether it's budget projections or whatever, I think there's a track record that goes along a lot of times with whether or not the projections in certain areas -- whether it's unemployment, budgetary numbers, whatever -- what the track record is. All I'm suggesting to you is very clearly that the numbers that they gave the last time they did health care were off by more than 50 percent when it came to the number of people insured. That's not my interpretation, that's a fact. And I think it's important for people to understand the differences. Eamon. Q: Sean, on Preet Bharara, I guess there are two possibilities here. One is the President made a commitment to keep him back in November, and the other one is that he didn't. Preet Bharara came down to the lobby of Trump Tower and said that the President had made that commitment. Did the President, in fact, make that commitment to Preet Bharara? MR. SPICER: I don't think it really matters. At the end of the day, the Attorney General followed a practice that existed for the last several administrations and asked every attorney general in the last administration to submit their resignation. So, I mean, it is -- Q: It matters in ongoing investigations, and it also matters in the sense that the President made a commitment. If he made a commitment, why did he change his mind? Why did he go back on it? MR. SPICER: Well, again, as I mentioned earlier, he called him to thank him for his service last week. He followed in the past practice of last several administration and asked everybody to step down. And I think that's the appropriate thing.  Q: Sean, but what's changed from November to now? MR. SPICER: I called on someone. Q: Sean, thank you. Ronica Cleary from Fox 5, thank you. I have two questions. The first, I think especially in light of what has happened in the room here today, the President tweeted this morning that much of the media is being rude and that we should be nice. So my question is, is it our job to be nice? And do you think we're nice? (Laughter.)  MR. SPICER: Thank you, Ronica. I will just leave it at this. I think that I've been asked for my personal opinion several times. That's not my job. I don't get up here to speak for myself. I speak for the President. I think that he has been very clear that he doesn't believe some of the behavior and the reporting has been appropriate. And to Hallie's point, I will let the tweet speak for itself. Ronica, number two. Q: Second question. But this is about you. The interaction you had at the Apple store this weekend -- what would be, I guess, your message to individuals who want to maybe -- I see that woman was, you could argue, very aggressive. If somebody doesn't want to be aggressive and has a question for you, what would you be your kind of message to a regular citizen that has an issue? MR. SPICER: Ask it. I interact with individuals all day long. Ninety-nine percent of them are pleasant, even with people who may not agree with our philosophy or programs or whatever. But it's a free country, and the beauty of it is that people can act how they want, no matter how that's interpreted. And as long as they stay on the right side of the First Amendment, we're good. Francesca. Q: Thank you, Sean. You said that when the President said wiretapping in that tweet he meant a whole host of surveillance types. So that we can be crystal clear, what surveillance types was he referring to then? What would you consider part of that range? MR. SPICER: Well, I mean, I think there's a whole host of tactics that can be used to monitor somebody -- either through wiretap or other ways in which you can surveil somebody. Q: We took that to mean monitoring his calls, specifically. So what else would you include in that range? MR. SPICER: I think there's a whole host of things that fall into that category. So I'm not sure how you took it, but there is a wide range of ways in which somebody can be monitored or followed up on. And I think that if you contacted one of the law enforcement agencies, they will provide you with a whole host of ways. Thank you, all. Be safe tomorrow with the snow. Thank you very much. Take care. Stay safe.  END 2:06 P.M. EDT"
